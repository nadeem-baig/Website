 {"id":3, "name":"Alopecia (hair loss)", "intro":"Partial or complete loss of hair is called alopecia. Hair loss usually develops gradually and may be patchy or diffuse (all over). One loses up to 100 hair from the scalp everyday.\nBaldness is not usually caused by disease. It is also related to aging, heredity or changes in the hormones. There can be male pattern baldness or female pattern baldness.", "symtoms":"", "causes":"There are many reasons for hair loss.\u00a0 It include following reasons:\n\nHair Disorders\n\n\nHereditary thinning or baldness: It is also called\u00a0androgenetic alopecia. It is regarded as the most common cause of hair loss. Hereditary hair loss in men is seen as a receding hairline as well as hair loss on top of the scalp. Women, on the other hand, tends to have their hairline and have visible thinning of hair \u00a0over the front and top of the scalp.\n\nAlopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. It develops in people of all ages and hair is lost in patches\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nCicatricial (scarring) alopecia: It can develop in \u00a0otherwise healthy men and women, cicatricial alopecia is a rare condition that destroys hair follicles. Scar tissue forms where the follicles once were and re-growth is not possible. Treatment attempts to stop the inflammation that destroys the hair follicles.\n\n\nDisease\n\n\nUnderlying medical condition: Decreasing hair loss is regarded as warning sign for about 30 diseases. Hair loss often can be stopped or reversed with treatment for the underlying disease. Medical conditions that lead to hair loss are thyroid disease and anaemia caused by an iron deficiency.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nSome cancer treatments: Radiation therapy and some chemotherapeutic medications can also cause hair loss. While hair loss is usually temporary, it can be the most distressing part of therapy.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nRingworm of the scalp. Hair loss can also be caused due to \u00a0fungal infection, which is most common in children, can cause balding and scaling on the scalp.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nTrichotillomania. It is a disorder that causes people to repeatedly pull out their own hair. Aside from a constant urge to pull out the hair on the scalp, sufferers often say they feel compelled to pull out their eyelashes, nose hair, eyebrows, and other hair on their bodies.\n\n\nStress and Hormones\n\n\nStress: Hair loss can also occur if a person is mentally or physically stressed, or after a major surgery, high fever, severe infection, or even flu.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nHormone fluctuations: Any change in hormonal levels can cause hair loss especially in women. Hair loss is common during menopause and after childbirth due to falling oestrogen levels. When hair loss is caused by falling oestrogen levels, the loss is usually temporary. Hair can be re grown .\n\n\nDiet\n\n\nWeight loss: People having weight issues can also have hair loss. This hair loss is common, and hair growth does return to normal with proper diet and weight.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nVitamin A excess: Intake of too much vitamin A through vitamin supplements or medications can also lead to hair loss.\u00a0\n\nProtein intake too low: \u00a0\u00a0Hair loss can also occur when the body is not getting enough protein, it conserves the protein. It does get by shifting hair growth into the resting phase. Within 2 to 3 months, the person usually sees visible hair loss. This can be reversed and prevented by eating enough protein. \u00a0\n\nIron intake too low. Consuming too little iron can lead to hair loss. Good vegetarian sources of iron are iron-fortified cereals, soybeans, pumpkin seeds, white beans, lentils, and spinach. Clams, oysters, and organ meats top the list of good animal sources of iron.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nEating disorder. An eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia is the other cause of hair loss.\n\n\nMedication\n\tMedications that can cause hair loss include:\n\n\n\t\tBlood thinners\n\n\t\tHigh-dose vitamin A\n\n\t\tMedicines for arthritis, depression, gout, heart problems, and high blood pressure\n\n\t\tBirth control pills: Some women taking or discontinuing birth control pills experience hair loss. This usually occurs in women with an inherited tendency toward hair thinning.\n\n\nHair Care Practices\n\n\nHair cosmetics:\u00a0 Frequent colouring of hair can cause the hair to break. Regular or improper use of dyes, gels, relaxers, and sprays also can cause hair breakage. Dermatologists recommend limiting use of these hair cosmetics to reduce hair breakage.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nBlow dryers, flat irons, and similar devices. Regular use of a blow dryer tends to damage hair. The high heat from a blow dryer can boil the water in the hair shaft leaving the hair brittle and prone to breakage. Allowing the hair to air dry and styling \u00a0it only when dry will lessen this risk. Dermatologists also recommend limiting the use of flat irons, which straighten hair by using high heat, and other devices such as curling irons.\n\nHairpins, clips, and rubber bands: If hair are held tightly with hairpins, clips, and rubber bands, it can break hair. To minimize hair breakage, one should use loosely fitting clips and wear them in different areas of the scalp so that hair breakage is not localized in a specific area.\n\nToo much or vigorous grooming: Regular shampooing, combing, or brushing (100 strokes or more a day) or doing any of these too vigorously can cause hair breakage. When hair breakage occurs, the hair appears shaggy or too thin.", "diagnosis":"Dermatologists can diagnose hair loss by asking questions about medical history, family history. A dermatologist may also carefully look at the scalp\u00a0 to know the condition of scalp.", "management":"Treatment of hair loss depends upon the cause of disease.\u00a0\n\nTreatment available without a prescription\u00a0\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nMinoxidil:\u00a0This medicine is applied to the scalp. It can stop hair from getting thinner and also stimulate hair growth on the top of the scalp. It is the only hair re-growth product approved for men and women. A dermatologist generally combine minoxidil with another treatment.\n\nLaser devices:\u00a0Brushes, combs, and other hand-held devices that emit laser light also stimulate hair growth. These devices might make hair look more youthful in some people. Because the FDA classifies these products as medical devices, the products do not undergo the rigorous testing that medicines undergo. The long-term effectiveness and safety for these devices are not known.\n\n\nPrescription medicine\u00a0\n\nFinasteride:\u00a0The FDA approved this medicine to treat men with hair loss. It comes in pill form and helps slow hair loss in most (about 88%) men. It helps stimulate hair re-growth in many (about 66%) men. Finasteride works by stopping the body from making a male hormone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT).\n\n\nCorticosteroid:\u00a0If your hair loss is caused by inflammation in body, a dermatologist may inject a medicine called a corticosteroid into scalp. This can help stop the inflammation that happens when a person has alopecia areata. A corticosteroid is different from an anabolic steroid.\n\n\nProcedures\n\tThe type of procedure that a dermatologist recommends will depend on how much hair\u00a0you have lost. To achieve the best results, a dermatologist may use one or more of the following procedures:\n\n\nHair transplantation:\u00a0Skin on the scalp that has good hair growth is removed and transplanted to areas of the scalp that need hair.\n\nScalp reduction:\u00a0Bald scalp is surgically removed and hair-bearing scalp is brought closer together to reduce balding. Scalp reduction surgery can be performed alone or in conjunction with a hair transplant.\n\nScalp expansion:\u00a0Devices are inserted under the scalp for about 3 to 4 weeks to stretch the skin. This procedure may be performed before a scalp reduction to make the scalp more lax. It also can be performed solely to stretch hair-bearing areas, which reduces balding.\n\nScalp flaps:\u00a0A hair-bearing segment of scalp is surgically moved and placed where hair is needed.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

These tests include:\n\nWindow period:\u00a0There is a period of time between HIV infection and the appearance of anti-HIV antibodies that can be measured which is called \"window period\".\u00a0Antibody tests may give false negative (no antibodies are detected despite the presence of HIV) results during the window period, an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV infection and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV sero conversion.\n\nCD4 count: CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that's specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. A healthy person's CD4 count can vary from 500 to more than 1,000. Even if a person has no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when his or her CD4 count becomes less than 200.\n\nRapid or point-of-care tests:\u00a0The rapid test is an immunoassay used for screening, and it produces quick results, in 20 minutes or less. Rapid tests use blood or oral fluid to look for antibodies to HIV. If an immunoassay (lab test or rapid test) is conducted during the window period \u00a0(i.e., the period after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test may not find antibodies and may give a false negative result. All immunoassays that are positive need a follow up test to confirm the result.\n\nELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay):\u00a0ELISA is set of blood tests used to diagnose HIV infection. \u00a0ELISA test is performed by inserting a needle to draw blood. A positive result on the ELISA screening test does not necessarily mean that the person has HIV infection. Certain conditions may lead to a false positive result, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and lupus.\n\nRNA tests\u00a0: It detects the virus directly (instead of the antibodies to HIV) and thus can detect HIV at about 10 days after infection, as soon as it appears in the bloodstream, before antibodies develop. These tests cost more than antibody tests and are generally not used as a screening test, although doctor may order one as a follow-up test, after a positive antibody test, or as part of a clinical workup.\n\nWestern Blot:\u00a0A positive ELISA test is always followed by a Western blot test which confirm HIV infection.\n\n\t*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

When under control, the asthma patient can lead a perfectly normal life, work, attend classes, take part in sports, avoid most asthma attacks and sleep well. In order to achieve asthma control the asthma medication has to be taken as advised by the physician and one should also avoid things that trigger asthma attacks which may include animals with fur, cigarette smoke, smoke, dust from sweeping, dust in beds and pillows, strong smells, pollen, inclement weather, and colds. One should also well acquaint with symptoms and signs of worsening of asthma control and know how to respond to it.\n\n\tPreventer medicines (inhaled form) can, if so advised, be taken regularly on long term basis and are not habit forming. It may be necessary to take the preventive medicine every day if one coughs and wheezes or has a tight chest more than twice a week, wakes up at night due to asthma attacks, or has to use the reliever medication more often than twice a week to stop an asthma attack.

Although asthma is a chronic condition, there are excellent means to control this disorder.\n\nPatients with asthma should not take part in physical exercise: Exercise is good for asthma patients just as well as those without it. Proper medical advice is essential before undertaking such activities.\n\nAsthma cure can be achieved with transfer of residence to a \u201cbetter\u201d climate: Proer use of medication and usual precautions at home and workplace is most important for achieving asthma control.\n\n\u201cInhalers\u201d are the last resort for control of asthma: Asthma medication is ideally administered by the inhaled route so as to ensure prompt and targeted drug delivery with least side effects. It is true for even the mildest form of the disease.\n\n\u201cInhalers\u201d are addictive or habit forming: These are not habit forming medicines at all. However, asthma being a chronic disease, they may be required to be administered on a long term basis under proper medical guidance.\n\nSteroids used in asthma are dangerous drugs: The benefits of inhaled corticosteroids that are used in asthma are far more than the risks involved. This is true even in growing children. The use of asthma medication should be under medical guidance.\n\nAsthma is a psychological disease: Asthma is NOT a psychological disease although emotional factors can trigger an asthma attack.\n\nAsthma is contagious disease: This is not true.\n\nAsthma patients should avoid \u201ccold\u201d food like milk, curd etc.: There are no food restrictions in asthma. However in case there is an identifiable food item that has been known to trigger asthma attack in a particular patient, this item must be avoided.\n\nRegular use of asthma medicines make them ineffective: This is incorrect. Some medicines are effective only if used regularly. Use of any asthma medication should be under medical guidance.\n\nIn children nebulizers are the ideal method of administering asthma medication: Metered dose inhaler with spacer and mask device are equally effective in drug delivery in small children.", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Infected animals shed the bacilli in terminal hemorrhage or spilt blood at death. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years.\n\n\tHumans almost invariably contract the natural disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products.\n\n\tAnthrax is existed in many parts of the world, including Asia, southern Europe, sub-Sahelian Africa and parts of Australia.

Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.\n\nCutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, hides, wool, bones and skin.\n\nGastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea.\n\nPulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in.

This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to\u00a0\u00a0 organs and other parts of your body.\n\n\tAtherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including\u00a0heart attack,\u00a0stroke, or even death.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/causes\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/atrisk\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/signs\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/diagnosis\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/treatment\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis/prevention", "symtoms":"Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as\u00a0 \u00a0heart attack\u00a0or\u00a0stroke.\n\n\tSome people may have signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected.\n\nCoronary Arteries\n\n\tThe coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to\u00a0\u00a0 heart. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called\u00a0coronary heart disease, or CHD), it may lead to\u00a0\u00a0 angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when\u00a0\u00a0 heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\n\n\tAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in\u00a0\u00a0 chest. Pain may also be felt in shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.\n\n\tOther symptoms of CHD are shortness of breath and\u00a0arrhythmias\u00a0Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\n\n\tPlaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is called\u00a0coronary microvascular disease\u00a0(MVD). Symptoms of coronary MVD include angina, shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.\n\nCarotid Arteries\n\n\tThe carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to\u00a0\u00a0 brain. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called\u00a0carotid artery disease), one may have symptoms of\u00a0\u00a0 stroke. These symptoms may include:\n\n\n\t\tSudden weakness\n\n\t\tParalysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body\n\n\t\tConfusion\n\n\t\tTrouble speaking or understanding speech\n\n\t\tTrouble seeing in one or both eyes\n\n\t\tDifficulty in breathing\n\n\t\tDizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls\n\n\t\tLoss of consciousness\n\n\t\tSudden and severe headache\n\n\nPeripheral Arteries\n\n\tPlaque also can build up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis (a disease called\u00a0peripheral artery disease).\n\n\tIf these major arteries are narrowed or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and sometimes dangerous infections.\n\nRenal Arteries\n\n\tThe renal arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to\u00a0\u00a0 kidneys. If plaque builds up in these arteries, one may develop\u00a0chronic kidney disease. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function.\n\n\tEarly kidney disease often has no signs or symptoms. As the disease gets worse, it can cause tiredness, changes in how you urinate (more often or less often), loss of appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), swelling in the hands or feet, itchiness or numbness and trouble concentrating.", "causes":"The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that atherosclerosis is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. It develops faster as you age.\n\n\tAtherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include:\n\n\n\t\tSmoking\n\n\t\tHigh amounts of certain fats and\u00a0cholesterol\u00a0in the blood\n\n\t\tHigh blood pressure\n\n\t\tHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due to\u00a0insulin resistance\u00a0or\u00a0diabetes\n\n\nRisk Factors\n\n\tThe exact cause of atherosclerosis is not clear but certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise\u00a0\u00a0 risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you'll develop atherosclerosis.\n\nMajor Risk Factors\n\n\nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol).\n\nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or\u00a0chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury\u2014the units used to measure blood pressure.)\n\nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, raise cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesn't allow enough oxygen to reach body tissues.\n\nInsulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used as an energy source. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes.\n\nDiabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.\n\nOverweight or obesity. The terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\n\nLack of\u00a0physical activity. A lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\n\nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated and\u00a0trans\u00a0fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other atherosclerosis risk factors.\n\nOlder age. As one gets older,\u00a0\u00a0 risk for atherosclerosis increases. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in\u00a0\u00a0 arteries with ageing. By the time you're middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs or symptoms. In men, the risk increases after the age of 45. In women, the risk increases after the age of 55.\n\nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age.", "diagnosis":"Physical Exam\n\n\t\u00a0Physical examination may show weak or absent pulse (e.g. in leg or foot). A weak or absent pulse can be a sign of\u00a0\u00a0 blocked artery.\n\nDiagnostic Tests\n\n\tOne or more tests may be required to diagnose atherosclerosis.\u00a0 Extent of disease so determined by tests, helps in planning the treatment.\n\nBlood Tests\n\n\tBlood tests\u00a0check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in\u00a0\u00a0 blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for atherosclerosis.\n\nECG (Electrocardiogram)\n\n\tAn ECG can show signs of heart damage caused by CHD. The test also can show signs of a previous or current\u00a0heart attack.\n\nChest x- Ray\n\n\tA\u00a0chest x- ray\u00a0takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of\u00a0heart failure.\n\nAnkle/Brachial Index\n\n\tThis test compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm to see how well your blood is flowing. This test can help diagnose P.A.D (Peripheral Arterial Disease).\n\nOther Tests\n\n\tOther tests are being studied to see whether they can give a better view of plaque build up in the arteries. Examples of these tests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).", "management":"Management for atherosclerosis may include\u00a0heart-healthy lifestyle changes,\u00a0medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include:\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLowering the risk of blood clot\u00a0 forming\n\n\t\t\tPreventing atherosclerosis-related diseases\n\n\t\t\tReducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the build up of plaque\n\n\t\t\tRelieving symptoms\n\n\t\t\tWidening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries\n\n\nMedicines\n\n\t\tSometimes lifestyle changes alone aren\u2019t enough to control\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol levels. For example, one may also\u00a0\u00a0 need statin medications to control or lower\u00a0\u00a0 cholesterol. By lowering\u00a0\u00a0 blood cholesterol level, one can decrease\u00a0\u00a0 chances of having a heart attack or stroke.\n\nMedical Procedures and Surgery\n\n\t\tPatients with severe atherosclerosis may require a medical or surgical procedure.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Amoebiasis can be prevented and controlled both by non-specific and specific measures.\n\n\tNon-specific measures are concerned with-\n\n\nImproved water supply- The cysts are not killed by chlorine in amount used for water disinfection.

 {"id":17, "name":"Anisometropia", "intro":"Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis. \u00a0AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.\n\n\tThe incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.\n\n\tIn the year 1952, Hogan described bilateral conjunctivitis occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (coined the term atopic keratoconjunctivitis), which flared-up with worsening dermatitis. Patients notably showed chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis may evolve independent of dermatitis in some patients. Hogan\u2019s criteria to aid in diagnosis is presence or history of eczematous dermatitis, a family history of atopic disease, associated allergies (asthma, hay fever), eosinophilia and a characteristic keratoconjunctivitis associated with exacerbations of dermatitis. His patients were notable for chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation.\n\n\tAtopic keratoconjunctivitis represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). The potential for corneal involvement and opacification increases significantly with the CACs because of the severity and sustained nature of their inflammation. In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. However, clinical and patho-physiological features of AKC are quite different from other allergic conjunctivitis. \u00a0AKC like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a severe inflammatory disease, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment. The highest incidence of visual loss is therefore, found in AKC, the most chronic of these disorders.\n\n\tChronic allergic conjunctivitis characteristically involves an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated type I hypersensitivity response, manifested by papillary conjunctivitis, with itching as a universal early symptom. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with type I and a prominent T-cell mediated type IV response, along with variety of other inflammatory cell types and cytokines, contribute to the inflammatory changes of conjunctiva and cornea seen in AKC.\n\n\tAKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively, while SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis.\n\n\tAKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity. VKC is more frequently seasonal, and is generally worse in the spring season. AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in winter. Patients are sensitive to a wide range of airborne environmental allergens.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\n\tAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.Textbook of Ophthalmology Volume 1.First Edition.

Serum IgE levels are chronically elevated in AKC patients but their levels are not necessarily correlated to severity of disease.

Bulbar conjunctiva typically displays diffuse chemosis and injection.\n\n\t-\u00a0Conjuctival scarring: Conjuctival scarring may occur, often in reticular or septal pattern.\n\n\t-\u00a0Symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation: Sub-epithelial fibrosis can, in severe cases, lead to symblepharon formation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Forniceal foreshortening: Forniceal foreshortening may also result from sub-epithelial fibrosis.\n\n\t-\u00a0Limbus: Limbus may become infiltrated and oedematous, and develop gelatinous limbal thickening, consisting of confluent macro-papillae, is sometimes seen.\n\n\t-\u00a0Trantas dots: Trantas dots, tiny white lesions consisting of necrotic epithelial cells and eosinophils, may be observed, similar to those in VKC.\n\nCornea:\n\n\tCorneal disease may be complicated by late development of corneal hypaesthesia in patients with AKC, resulting in a paradoxic reduction in surface symptoms, including itching.\n\n\t-\u00a0Punctate epithelial keratopathy: Punctate epithelial keratopathy is the most common corneal finding.\n\n\t-\u00a0Filamentary keratitis: Filamentary keratitis may occur, sometimes with very thick mucoid filamentary strands and possibly related to tear film instability, due to goblet cell abnormalities and deficient mucin secretion, also commonly featured in AKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0Persistent epithelial defects: \u00a0Persistent epithelial defects frequently occur in the setting of a dry and inflamed ocular surface and may eventually lead to macro-erosions. Macro-erosions in atopic patient may progress to frank bacterial ulcers.\n\n\t-\u00a0Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation: Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation may also develop. Adherent mucus plaques contain epithelial debris, eosinophils, and inflammatory cells, and probably result from a combination of mechanical irritation from giant papillae, as well as toxic epithelial changes secondary to inflammation. Persistence of these plaques may eventually cause stromal thinning and perforation. The chronic inflammation and mechanical insult from palpebral scarring may result in partial or total limbal stem cell deficiency. Chronic inflammation and superimposed infection may lead to corneal scarring, neovascularisation, and lipid deposition. Vision may decline due to obscuration of the visual axis, irregular astigmatism, and/or ocular surface compromise.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pannus formation: Severe pannus often develops, typically affecting the superior one-third of the cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pseudogerontoxon: \u00a0Pseudogerontoxon may be seen in the peripheral cornea, which resembles a short, circumferential segment of arcus-senilis (white or grey opaque ring in corneal margin). This localised area of lipid deposition, related to abnormal vascular permeability at the limbus, may be the only evidence of previous atopic disease in a quiet eye.\n\nOther complications/features:\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid inflammation: Eyelid inflammation is common in AKC, often related to staphylococcal blepharitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis are found to have high rates of bacterial skin colonisation, specifically with staphylococcal species.\n\n\t-\u00a0Corneal super-infections: AKC patients are at higher risk of corneal super-infections because of an unstable ocular surface, the local bacterial colonisation of the eyelids, and a dysfunctional innate immune system. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, frequently bilateral, is another well known complication of AKC, and is presumably related to abnormalities in the atopic host\u2019s immune defences. Herpetic epithelial lesions may be recurrent, especially when topical or systemic immune-suppressants are required to control the atopic state. Management is especially difficult because epithelial AKC lesions may be difficult to distinguish from HSV keratitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0Development of cataract: Rapidly progressive cataracts frequently develop in AKC patients, classically described as anterior sub-capsular opacities, usually stellate or shield like in appearance. The pathogenesis for atopic cataract is unclear, and it is suggested that high levels of IgE may be correlated with development of cataract in these patients. The chronic use of topical steroids also predisposes to posterior sub-capsular cataracts in AKC patients. Other forms of cataract may form independent of corticosteroid use, especially in patients with severe systemic atopic disease.\n\n\t-\u00a0Keratoconus: A higher incidence of keratoconus is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pellucid marginal degeneration: A higher incidence of pellucid marginal degeneration is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Retinal detachment: Slightly higher rate of retinal detachment has also been noted in AKC patients. This may also be related to chronic eye rubbing, inducing degenerative vitreous changes.\n\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\n\n\tHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies of conjunctival specimens reveal increased number of mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes and neutrophils in AKC patients.\n\n\tMast cells and eosinophils have not only been detected in conjunctival epithelium, but are also present in increased numbers in the substantia propria. A surplus of Langerhans cells, macrophages and B cells in the substantia propria is also seen.\n\n\tT-lymphocyte infiltration is apparent in both conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria in AKC. T-helper (Th) cells predominate in all allergic eye diseases. Of the major T-cell subtypes, the Th1 subtype is involved in cellular immunity, whereas Th2 subtype is involved in humoral immune responses, including those mediated by IgE. Th2 cells are involved in eosinophil recruitment and stimulate IgE production from B cells. Th2 cytokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in AKC.\n\n\tActivated eosinophils recruit additional inflammatory cells to the ocular surface. They release chemo-attractants which attract neutrophils to the conjunctiva. Eosinophils are also major players in the development of sight-threatening corneal complications in AKC.\n\n\tConjunctival Epithelial cells and Fibroblasts express pro-inflammatory mediators in VKC. The expression of surface adhesion molecules and the release of cytokines by epithelial cells enhance recruitment of eosinophils. Conjunctival fibroblasts, when activated by Th cytokines, promote local accumulation of eosinophils and enhance eosinophil degranulation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSecondary structural changes:\n\n\tExtensive inflammation in AKC leads to chronic ocular surface alterations:\n\n\t-\u00a0Goblet cell loss/hyperplasia: Both goblet cell loss (based on impression cytology), as well as goblet cell hyperplasia (based on conjunctival biopsy) have been reported. Goblet cell production of mucin is altered.\n\n\t-\u00a0Tear film instability: Tear film instability, with increased tear break-up time (BUT) but normal tear production, has also been described.\n\n\t-\u00a0Corneal sensation: Corneal sensations are reduced in AKC..\n\n\t-Squamous metaplasia: Squamous metaplasia has also been described in patients with AKC.\n\nConfocal microscopy studies:\n\n\tAKC is associated with alterations in basal epithelium and sub-basal corneal nerves which relate to changes in tear function and corneal sensitivity. There is lower density of basal epithelial cells. \u00a0A decrease in number and density of sub-basal long nerve fibers causes decreased corneal sensation. Corneal nerves are thickened and have bifurcation abnormalities. Inflammatory cells and activated keratocytes are found in the superficial stroma.\n\nAKC should be differentiated from:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronic allergic conjunctivitis (e.g. VKC).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trachoma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSimilarities and differentiation from VKC:\n\nSimilarities:\n\n\t- Potentially blinding chronic disease: AKC and VKC are chronic, potentially blinding conditions.\n\n\t- Atopy: Both conditions present in individuals predisposed by an atopic background.\n\n\t- Hypersensitivity responses: Both diseases involve both type I and type IV hypersensitivity responses. Eosinophils and T lymphocytes are found to infiltrate the conjunctiva in both conditions.\n\n\t- Clinical features: Clinically, they are similar, with conjunctival inflammation, epithelial defects, shield ulcers, and corneal scarring as major features of both.\n\nDifferences:\n\n\t- Age groups: AKC presents at an older age than VKC. VKC usually \u2018burns out\u2019 by late puberty, whereas AKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\n\n\t- Visual prognosis: Visual prognosis is worse for AKC.\n\n\t- Peri-orbital skin and eyelid: There is increased peri-orbital and eyelid skin involvement in AKC as compared to VKC which generally spare skin.\n\n\t- Papillae: AKC usually presents with micro-papillae on the palpebral conjunctiva. Lower tarsus is preferentially involved in AKC, in contrast to VKC, in which papillae are much more prominent on the upper tarsus. Giant papillae are sometimes seen in AKC, but this is a definitive hallmark of VKC.\n\n\t- Eyelid margins: The eyelid margins are affected in AKC unlike VKC. Cicatricial changes, forniceal foreshortening, and symblepharon may be seen in AKC which are not usual in VKC.\n\n\t- Trantas dots: Trantas dots are more frequently associated with VKC than AKC.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tBecause of chronic nature of AKC, the balance of treatment efficacy and risk is often difficult. AKC is generally less responsive and requires more intensive and prolonged treatment.\n\n\tThe approach to management is multifaceted with the purpose of improving patient comfort and preventing the complications associated with AKC. Management involves multiple treatment arms viz. topical mast cell stabilisers, corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as topical cyclosporine. In more severe cases, systemic immune-suppression may be required.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\t-\u00a0Environmental allergens: Control of environmental allergens may be helpful, but antigen avoidance is usually an adjunctive therapy.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid hygiene: Because AKC involve the eyelids, in addition to the ocular surface, basic eyelid hygiene is essential. Eyelid scrubs should be part of daily routine in order to control blepharitis and the risk of staphylococcal keratitis. Antibiotic ointment may also be applied to the eyelid margins.\n\n\t-\u00a0Warm/cold compresses: Warm compresses improve tear film stability in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related to eyelid margin inflammation.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If severe itching or an exacerbation of peri-ocular atopic dermatitis is present, cold compresses will be more likely to provide symptomatic relief.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tAKC is primarily managed medically. However, elective surgery may be of benefit where inflammation is well controlled.\n\n\tThe goal of therapy should be the complete control of ocular surface inflammation with the safest medicines and lowest dosing needed to achieve this.\n\n\tMast cell stabilisers and antihistamines are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy. Antihistamines, steroids and immune-suppressants are used for immediate management of symptoms.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nEyelids:\n\n\t-\u00a0Emollients: Emollients applied to the eyelid skin help control peri-ocular eczema.\n\n\t-\u00a0Steroid ointments: Mild steroid ointments also help in controlling peri-ocular eczema. As with eye-drops, the duration of treatment should be minimised and the intraocular pressure monitored.\n\n\t-\u00a0Immunosuppressive agent: Tacrolimus ointment, a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, has also been shown to be effective in treating atopic dermatitis of the eyelids.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOcular surface:\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical artificial tears: Superficial punctate keratopathy requires aggressive lubrication, with preservative-free artificial tears and lubricating ointments, with the goal of increasing comfort and avoiding frank epithelial defects, which are typically more difficult to manage in atopes.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical antibiotic: If epithelial erosion does occur, topical antibiotic prophylaxis should be added to prevent bacterial super-infection and infectious keratitis, a complication of epithelial defects in AKC. All new epithelial defects should be cultured prior to initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n\t-\u00a0Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be applied to facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect.\n\n\t-\u00a0Scleral contact lenses: In patients with corneal epithelial or stromal irregularity but with good control of their AKC, scleral contact lenses may afford good vision and increased comfort, thus avoiding surgery.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent, may be used topically for dissolving mucus filaments and deposits, and addressing early plaque formation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical antihistamines: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of AKC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. These are generally not for continuous long term use, and several preparations are used in courses of limited duration. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.Topical antihistamines when used in isolation are about as effective as mast cell stabilisers. They are suitable for acute exacerbations but generally not for continuous long term use, and courses of several preparations are used in courses of limited duration.\n\n\t-\u00a0Systemic antihistamines:\u00a0 Systemic antihistamines help itching, promote sleep and reduce nocturnal eye rubbing. Because other inflammatory mediators are involved besides histamines, effectiveness is not assured. Some antihistamines (e.g.loratadine) cause relatively little drowsiness.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical mast cell stabilisers: Initial management of conjunctival inflammation may involve topical mast cell stabilisers. Topical mast cell stabilisers reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and the need for steroids and so form the basis of many regimens, but are seldom effective in isolation. Several days to weeks of treatment are needed for a reasonable response. The mast cell stabilisers include sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide and pemirolast, which may be effective as maintenance therapy in mild cases of AKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties, and are more frequently employed for allergic eye diseases. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action.Although these agents have little direct effect on the T-cell mediated inflammation, they may reduce overall induction of inflammation and, importantly, reduce mechanical eye rubbing, associated with the development of keratoconus and possibly AKC-associated cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve comfort by blocking non-histamine mediators. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\n\n\t-Topical corticosteroid therapy: More severe inflammation in AKC usually requires topical corticosteroid therapy. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile. Since the inflammation in AKC is on the ocular surface, corticosteroids with significant intraocular penetration should be avoided when possible. Steroid-related side effects, such as cataract and elevated intraocular pressure are often inevitable for AKC patients. Superior tarsal injection of corticosteroids is effective in refractory cases, though this treatment option may also be limited by side effects.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical immune-modulator drugs: Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, such as topical cyclosporine, have immune-modulatory effect by reducing Th cells, B cells and macrophages after treatment. Side effects include intense stinging and prolonged blurred vision. Tacrolimus ointment also inhibits T-cell production with greater potency than cyclosporine.\n\n\t-\u00a0Systemic immune suppression: \u00a0Advanced and refractory AKC may sometimes necessitate systemic immune-suppression, in order to prevent sight-threatening complications. Agents reported to be beneficial include prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and azathioprine.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The benefits of immune-suppressants, both systemic and local, must be balanced against the significant risk of infection, both bacterial and viral.\u00a0\n\n\t- \u00a0Allergen desensitisation: Allergen desensitisation may be effective in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\n\n\t-\u00a0Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis may be done in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\t-\u00a0Superficial keratectomy: Shield ulcer plaques, consisting of epithelial and inflammatory debris at the base of an ulcer, often are resistant to treatment with topical anti-inflammatory therapy. Superficial keratectomy may be required to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation. Medical treatment must be maintained until the cornea has re-epithelialised in order to prevent recurrences.\n\n\t-\u00a0Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is an alternative to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Penetrating keratoplasty (full-thickness corneal transplant): Corneal scarring and occasionally perforation may occur in severe cases and necessitate penetrating keratoplasty.\n\n\t-\u00a0Papillary resection: Papillary resection with or without mitomycin-C (MMC) application has been described as a method to reduce ocular surface inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Surface maintenance/restoration procedures: Surface maintenance/restoration procedures may be required for severe persistent epithelial defects or ulceration. Various procedures may be:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01.\u00a0 Amniotic membrane overlay grafting.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02.\u00a0 Lamellar keratoplasty (partial-thickness corneal transplant).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. \u00a0Eyelid procedures such as botulinum toxin-induced ptosis or lateral tarsorrhaphy (surgical fusion of upper and lower eyelid margin to narrow the eyelid opening). \u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04.\u00a0 Gluing may be appropriate for focal (\u2018punched-out\u2019) corneal perforations.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid surgery: In advanced AKC, extensive scarring of the ocular surface and eyelid margins may necessitate eyelid surgery. This includes lid margin tightening and rotational procedures for lid mal-position, as well as symblepharon lysis and forniceal reconstruction for severe conjunctival scarring.\n\n\t-\u00a0Cataract surgery: Many patients will require cataract surgery at a relatively young age due to atopic and steroid-induced cataract development.\n\n\t-\u00a0Glaucoma surgery: A few patients may need glaucoma filtering surgery or valve placement if steroid-induced glaucoma develops.\n\n\t-\u00a0Stem cell transplantation: Patients who develop limbal stem cell deficiency may require ocular surface stem cell transplantation for visual rehabilitation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tAssociated systemic conditions should be treated as well. Uncontrolled dermatitis with vision-threatening complications requires systemic steroids.\n\n\tAny associated Herpes simplex keratitis should be treated with topical antiviral agents. Recurrent attacks of Herpes infection may require systemic antiviral also.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tAKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\n\n\tProper prophylaxis, prompt treatment and planned surgical management can reduce the incidence of poor vision and blindness.\n\n\tAKC is a potentially blinding disease. AKC may result in diminished vision or blindness from superficial punctate keratitis, persistent corneal epithelial defects, corneal scarring or thinning, cataract, keratoconus and symblepharon formation.\n\n\tPatients should be observed frequently until the ocular surface disease is stable. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or immuno- suppressives, should have regular examination for drug-induced adverse effects. Corticosteroids promote the development of cataract, glaucoma and may lead to secondary corneal infections.", "complications":"AKC may be associated with complications/ features like:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ptosis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tylosis (thickening of eyelid margin).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Staphylococcal blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conjunctival fornix foreshortening.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recurrent herpes simplex keratitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal scarring.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal thinning.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal perforation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pellucid marginal degeneration.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anterior sub-capsular cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Posterior sub-capsular cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Degenerative vitreous changes.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal detachment.", "Prevention":"To prevent adult inclusion conjunctivitis, patients should follow safe sexual practices.\n\n\tPatients should be educated about the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Wild water fowl such as ducks and geese are mostly affected by AI, but often show no apparent signs of illness. Poultry birds are also susceptible to AI infection that can cause large outbreaks and epidemics in poultry.\n\n\tHumans are not usually affected by AI virus, however some subtypes of AI such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2, have also infected people.\n\n\tAvian influenza A(H5N1) subtype virus is highly pathogenic virus. It was first recognized in \u00a0\u00a0humans in 1997 during the poultry outbreak in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. Since its re-emergence in 2003, outbreaks of A (H5N1) have reported from poultry in Asia to Europe, and Africa. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 16 countries have reported 846 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, including 449 deaths since 2003 through 20 January 2016.Out of 16 countries, 4 were in South-East Asia Region; Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\n\t10 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A (H5N6) virus including 6 deaths have been detected in China since 2013.\n\n\tIn March 2013, a subtype of influenza virus, A(H7N9) was detected first time in humans in China.

 {"id":19, "name":"Asbestos-related diseases", "intro":"Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in different meridian. As a result, the light rays entering the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines.\n\n\tAs described by Bannon and Walsh (1945), astigmatism was first mentioned in 1727 by Sir Issac Newton. But Thomas Young in 1800 published first description of astigmatism.\n\n\tRefractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.\n\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\n\n\tThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.\n\n\tPrevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age. The majority of children and young adults have a small amount of with-the-rule astigmatism, but in later adult years, there is a tendency for with-the-rule astigmatism to decrease in amount and for against-the-rule astigmatism to increase.\n\n\tAstigmatism is divided as\n\n\nRegular astigmatism: It is correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. It may be\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest corneal meridian is close to 90\u02da.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Against-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest meridian is close to 180\u02da.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oblique astigmatism: Principal meridians do not lie close to 90\u02da or 180\u02da.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bi- oblique astigmatism: The two principal meridians are not at right angle to each other.\n\n\nIrregular astigmatism: It is not correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. Patients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity and poor quality of vision. Irregular astigmatism may result from corneal diseases, such as keratoconus, trauma or scarring following herpes infection. It may also be produced due to cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty or elective kerato-refractive surgery.\n\n\n\tDepending on spherical ametropia of a particular eye, astigmatism may be classified as simple or compound based on whether one or both meridians, respectively, are focused outside the retina. If one meridian focuses in front of the retina and the other meridian focuses behind it, the astigmatism is called mixed astigmatism.\n\n\tIn astigmatism, the eye has different refractive powers along different meridians. Light entering in vertical direction gets focused differently than light in the horizontal direction. The meridian of steeper curvature has greater refractive power. The astigmatic eye produces a blurred image because two focal lines of images are being produced. This requires different corrections along each of these meridians to produce a single focused image on the retina.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nSihota Ramanjit, Tandon Radhika.

It may be of following types:\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Curvature astigmatism: Congenital abnormalities of lens curvature may produce small amount of curvature astigmatism. Marked lenticular astigmatism may be seen in condition like lenticonus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Positional astigmatism: Congenital tilting or oblique placement of lens may produce small amount of astigmatism. Congenital or traumatic subluxation of lens may also produce astigmatism of varying degrees.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Index astigmatism: Variable degree of change in refractive index of crystalline lens of patients suffering from diabetes or nuclear sclerosis may occur.\n\n\nRetinal astigmatism: Occasionally, obliquity of macula may produce retinal astigmatism.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOptics of regular astigmatism:\n\n\tIn regular astigmatism, the parallel rays of light are not focused at a point but form two focal lines. This configuration of refracted rays through astigmatic surface (or toric surface) is called Sturm\u2019s conoid and the distance between two focal lines is called focal interval of Sturm. Length of focal interval is a measure of the degree of astigmatism.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nII. Irregular astigmatism may be\n\n\nCorneal irregular astigmatism: Extensive corneal scarring or ectatic conditions like keratoconus may produce this.\n\nLenticular irregular astigmatism: This may be produced due to variable refractive index in different parts of the crystalline lens and rarely may occur during maturation of cataract.\n\nRetinal irregular astigmatism: It may be produced by distortion of the macular area due to scarring or tumours of retina and choroid pushing the macular area.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of astigmatism depends upon the symptoms and clinical features.\n\n\tRefractive error may be determined by\n\n\nRetinoscopy: Power in two different axes may be determined by retinoscopy.\n\nAstigmatic fan test: Astigmatic fan test is a sensitive test to find out astigmatism.\n\nJackson cross- cylinder test: Jackson cross- cylinder test helps in confirming the power and axis of cylindrical lenses.\n\nKeratometry: Keratometry reveals different corneal curvature in two separate meridians. Irregular astigmatism shows distorted keratometry.\n\nCorneal topography: Corneal topography is essential in understanding the shape and curvature of cornea, and helps in establishing diagnosis. Irregular astigmatism patients show irregularities on corneal topography.\n\nVery high frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound arc scanner: It is capable of obtaining 3- dimensional (3D) layered pachymetry across the central 10 mm of cornea. Resolution of scanner on cornea mode distinguishes individual corneal layers such as epithelium or stroma in all three dimensions, due to multi-meridional scanning.\n\nWavefront aberrometry: Wavefront aberrometry may help in diagnosis of irregular astigmatism and the assessment of the optical quality of the eye. Simulations of the retinal images are useful to understand some of the symptoms of irregular astigmatism. With corneal topographic analysis, the origin of irregular astigmatism from the cornea or internally, or both, may be specified by aberrometry. Clinical application of aberrometry is wavefront \u2013 guided refractive surgery.\n\n\nTypes of regular astigmatism:\n\n\tBased upon the axis and the angle between two principal meridia, regular astigmatism may be classified into:\n\n\nWith-the-rule astigmatism: The two principal meridia are placed at right angle to one another with vertical meridian steeper or more curved than the horizontal one. This is called with-the-rule astigmatism, because similar astigmatic condition exists normally due to eyelid pressure on cornea.\n\nAgainst-the-rule astigmatism: The two principal meridia are placed at right angle to one another with horizontal meridian steeper or more curved than the vertical one.\n\nOblique astigmatism: It is a type of regular astigmatism where two principal meridia, though placed at right angle, are not in vertical and horizontal meridian. Oblique astigmatism is often found to be symmetrical (e.g. cylindrical lens required at 30\u02da in both eyes) or complementary (e.g. cylindrical lens required at 30\u02da in one eye and at 150\u02da in the other eye).\n\nBi-oblique astigmatism: In this type, the two principal meridia are not at right angle to each other.\n\n\nRefractive types of regular astigmatism: Depending upon the position of two focal lines in relation to retina, regular astigmatism is classified into:\n\n\nSimple astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in one meridian only on the retina. The rays of light in other meridian are focused in front or behind retina. Accordingly, it is called\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simple myopic astigmatism: When the light rays of other meridian are focused in front of the retina.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simple hypermetropic astigmatism: When the light rays of other meridian are focused behind the retina.\n\n\nCompound astigmatism: The rays of light are focused either in front or behind the retina in both the meridia. Accordingly, it is called\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compound myopic astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in front of the retina in both the meridia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Compound hypermetropic astigmatism: The rays of light are focused behind the retina in both the meridia.\n\n\nMixed astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in front in one meridian and behind the retina in other meridian. Thus, eye is myopic in one meridian and it is hypermetropic in other. Such patients have relatively less symptoms as \u2018circle of least diffusion\u2019 forms on retina. It is presumed that a pencil of rays forms a minute circle of clear vision, called circle of least diffusion. Larger is the circle of least diffusion, poorer the vision.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical optical therapy: \n\n\tOptical therapy of regular astigmatism comprises of prescribing appropriate cylindrical lenses. The cylindrical lenses may be prescribed in the form of\n\n\nSpectacles: Regular astigmatism may be corrected with spherocylindrical lenses except where the meridians are not perpendicular. Parallel rays falling upon a cylindrical lens are affected in different ways. In the direction of its axis, it is simply a plane lamina with parallel sides, so that it has no effect on the rays. In the direction at right angles to its axis, it is spherical on one side and plane on the other. Therefore, it acts like a planoconvex or a planoconcave.\n\nContact lenses.\n\n\n\tGuidelines for optical correction:\n\n\nSmall astigmatism: Small astigmatism (about 0.5 dioptres or less) may be ignored and corrected only if there are symptoms of eye asthenopia or there is deterioration of vision.\n\nHigh astigmatism: Cylindrical error should be corrected as full as possible. An under correction may be prescribed to begin with if the patient is not comfortable with full correction. In all cases in which astigmatism produces asthenopic symptoms, full optical correction should be prescribed for constant use i.e. for distance as well as for near.\n\nChange in astigmatic correction: Change in astigmatic correction should preferably be avoided even if there is some improvement in visual acuity. Change in astigmatic correction may be given only if there is significant improvement in visual acuity and it may take some time to adjust.\n\n\n\tBi- oblique astigmatism, high astigmatism or mixed astigmatism is better treated by prescribing with contact lenses.\n\n\tPatients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity as well as visual quality. Pinhole occluders may provide some improvement in vision as compared to spectacles.\n\n\tOptical therapy of irregular astigmatism consists of prescribing contact lenses which replaces the affected anterior corneal surface for refraction. An improvement in vision may be obtained using gas permeable lenses as compared to soft hydrogel lenses.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\nIndications of surgery: Correction of astigmatism by surgery is done when it significantly affects vision. Typically, visually significant astigmatism is roughly more than 1 dioptres, although many patients may be symptomatic even with lower astigmatism. With improved surgical techniques such as excimer laser, even lower degree of astigmatism is being treated by surgical means. Usually surgery is done for\n\n\n\t\tIrregular astigmatism.\n\n\t\tPatients who wish to discard glasses or contact lenses.\n\n\t\tPatients who are intolerant of glasses or contact lenses.\n\n\t\tDevelopment of visually significant astigmatism following ocular surgery.\n\n\nSurgical therapy includes:\n\n\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Keratomileusis refers to carving of cornea. Astigmatism is corrected by combining central and peripheral treatments to differentially steepen the flattest corneal meridian and flatten the steepest meridian. Excimer laser ablation is applied directly to the corneal stroma after reflecting a lamellar or partial- thickness corneal flap. The flap is returned to its original position, once ablation is complete. Recovery of vision usually takes few days and some patients even take few weeks.\n\nWavefront- guided LASIK: Wavefront- guided LASIK or custom LASIK is a new wavefront technology to program ablation pattern more precisely than the conventional LASIK.\n\nIntraLASIK (IntraLase): IntraLASIK uses femtosecond laser, which is more accurate than a blade and provides a huge margin in terms of precision and safety. Femtosecond laser creates a corneal flap at a pre-programmed depth and position.\n\nEpiLASIK: EpiLASIK is designed to create a thin flap in the epithelium. It is an excellent alternative for patients with thin and steep or flat cornea. The layer is preserved and later replaced following reshaping of cornea using excimer laser.\n\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK): PRK also uses excimer laser to reshape cornea, but this procedure does not require lamellar flap. The laser is applied directly to the anterior stromal surface after removal of surface epithelium. A soft contact lens is prescribed after laser treatment. The corneal epithelium typically heals in about 4 to 7 days. Improvement of vision may take few weeks to several months.\n\nLaser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): It involves cleaving the epithelial sheet at the basement membrane with dilute alcohol, applying laser as in conventional PRK, and repositioning the epithelium afterward.\n\nPhotoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK): Photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) has been used to reduce astigmatism.\n\nRadial keratotomy (RK): Earlier RK as keratorefractive surgery was used, that effectively reduced astigmatism. In RK, spoke- like cuts radiating from central cornea at about 90% corneal depth were given to balloon the peripheral cornea. Although RK surgery was effective, the results were often unpredictable and led to overcorrection, with progressive hypermetropia. RK surgery was soon replaced by laser vision correction with the introduction of PRK.\n\nAstigmatic keratotomy (AK): Astigmatic keratotomy is a modification of RK surgery and is used to reduce corneal astigmatism. The two forms of corneal incisions, astigmatic keratotomy and limbal relaxing incisions (LRI), or more accurately peripheral corneal relaxing incisions (PCRI), are differentiated by their location on cornea. In both procedures, incisions are made to about 90% depth in cornea to flatten the steep meridian. PCRIs are easier to perform and have a weaker effect in correction because of their more peripheral location. Relaxing incisions, especially arcuate ones (arcuate keratotomy), are one of the commonly performed procedures for reduction of astigmatism. Femtosecond laser- enabled keratotomy has become an alternative to the mechanical techniques because of higher precision of incisions with improved accuracy and safety.\n\nRefractive lens exchange (RLE): Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is a surgical procedure that may correct refractive error by removing and replacing the clear crystalline lens of the eye with toric intraocular lenses (toric IOLs). RLE is an option for high refractive errors, where laser vision correction is not an option.\n\nPhakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant: Toric phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) may be implanted in front of and attached to the iris or is placed just behind the iris. Toric phakic IOL is an alternative to laser vision correction with keratorefractive surgery. Unlike RLE, all eye structures including crystalline lens, is not touched when a toric phakic IOL is implanted.\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty may be required in patients with affected cornea producing irregular astigmatism.\n\n\nContraindications to surgery:\n\n\n\t\tCorneal or anterior segment diseases such as keratitis, conjunctivitis or corneal ulcers.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Persons who work with poultry or who respond to avian influenza outbreaks are advised to use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow proper hand hygiene.\n\n\tSurveillance with Inter-sectoral coordination- Surveillance committees may be constituted at state and district level comprising experts from health, animal husbandry and other sectors for regular outbreak surveillance (early warning system) in domestic poultry, domestic birds and piggeries.\n\n\tWHO has advised that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals.\n\n\tTravellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water.

 {"id":20, "name":"Amblyopia", "intro":"Aphakia is a condition in which crystalline lens of the eye is not present in its normal position of pupillary area. Either there is no crystalline lens inside the eye or the lens is subluxated or luxated. This induces a refractive state which is not a refractive error in true sense. An emmetropic (normal refraction) eye or one having low grade ametropia (refractive error) becomes extremely hypermetropic after cataract surgery. A previously emmetropic eye requires a correction of about 10 to 11 dioptres (D) in spectacle when worn in the usual position.\n\n\tReplacement of the crystalline lens with a spectacle lens causes the image on patient\u2019s retina to be roughly 25% larger than the image formed with the crystalline lens. The exact magnification is determined by the power of the aphakic spectacles. There is about 2 % of magnification for each dioptre of power in the spectacles.\n\n\tAphakia comes from two Greek words (a means none and phacos means lens). It refers to both an anatomical and an optical condition.\n\nVon Helmholtz (1855) worked on the optics of aphakia. Benito Daza De Valdes (1623) suggested that aphakia may be corrected with spectacles.\n\nReferences:\n\nSihota Ramanjit, Tandon Radhika. Parsons\u2019 Diseases of the Eye Twenty Second Edition.

The recorded vision is theoretically better than the actual visual acuity.\n\nBinocular vision: Aniseikonia (unequal size of retinal image) less than 5 %, is compatible with binocular vision. Aniseikonia is harmful to the development of normal binocular function.\n\nDiplopia (double vision): Adult patients who have normal vision in un-operated eye find it difficult to attain binocular single vision and may suffer with diplopia.\n\nSuppression amblyopia: Monocular aphakic children usually develop suppression amblyopia. It may lead to deviation of the operated eye.\n\nAccommodation: Absence of crystalline lens leads to total loss of accommodation. Therefore, a patient needs bifocal, progressive or separate pair of glasses.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms and signs of aphakia.\n\nSigns of aphakia:\n\n\nRetinoscopy: Retinoscopy shows high hypermetropia.\n\nPurkinje\u2019s image: There are only two Purkinje\u2019s images coming from the cornea. Images from the lens surface are missing.\n\nScar at limbus: Surgical aphakia may show scar at the limbus.\n\nAnterior chamber: Anterior chamber is deep due to absence of lens from the eye.\n\nPupil: The pupil appears jet black in the absence of lens.\n\nIridodonesis: Iridodonesis or tremulousness of iris is present due to lack of support being provided by the lens.\n\nFundus: Examination shows hypermetropic fundus and the optic disc appears small.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical optical therapy:\n\n\tOptical therapy of aphakia comprises of prescribing appropriate convex lenses. The convex lenses may be prescribed in the form of\n\n\nSpectacles: \u00a0Usually about + 10 D of correction with appropriate cylindrical power for surgically induced astigmatism is prescribed to correct aphakia in previously emmetropic eye. Exact power of glasses required differs in individual cases. Further addition of plus power is required for presbyopia (near vision) to compensate for loss of accommodation. Aphakic spectacles may have glasses in various forms such as aspherical, lenticular or full field lenses. Spectacles causes\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magnification of image: The size of the image is magnified by about 25 %. Spectacles produce diplopia in cases of unilateral aphakia. The larger image of an object is interpreted to be closer to the eye. It requires efforts to coordinate between eyes and hand due to magnification. It produces difficulty in climbing stairs as well.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prismatic aberrations: It produces roving ring scotoma, usually described as Jack-in-the-box phenomenon. The prismatic effect is produced by the peripheral part of the correcting lens. It produces a ring scotoma. When patient sees an object and turns the eye towards it, the scotoma may shift inwards to occlude the object. On shifting the eye from the object, the scotoma shifts again and the object becomes visible.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spherical aberrations: When the objects are viewed through the periphery, the objects look enlarged, proximal, and elongated in radial direction. Pin-cushion effect produces distortion and it is the property of all plus lenses proportional to their diopteric power. This distortion makes a square look like a pincushion- the corners of the square have a stretched out appearance, and the sides are pushed in. The world becomes parabolic which continuously change its shape with eye movement. The objects appear to move faster. Driving a motor vehicle thus becomes very difficult.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Field of vision: Monocular as well as binocular field of vision is markedly reduced. The actual field of view through the spectacles is reduced by 25 %, which makes it impossible to see that much of peripheral field.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coloured vision: There may be coloured hue in the vision. It occurs due to absence of natural filter of a crystalline lens. Removal of the crystalline lens increases blue and ultraviolet transmission of light.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thick glasses: The glasses are very thick and heavy. Bifocal glasses are especially difficult to adjust with and may require separate pair.\n\n\nContact lenses: Correction of aphakia at the corneal plane requires use of contact lenses. As the position at which the optical correction is made moves closer to retina, the necessary diopteric power increases but the subsequent magnification decreases. A patient who needs 12.5 D in aphakic spectacles would need about 14.7 D in a soft rigid contact lens. At the corneal plane the magnification is 6- 8%. Since the value is near the limit of aniseikonia, most unilateral aphakia patients can have binocular vision. Contact lenses have certain advantages over the glasses such as\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Provides wider and better field of vision.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is less magnification of the image since the contact lenses are close to the cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More suited for uniocular aphakia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It eliminates spherical aberration and prismatic effect.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is cosmetically more acceptable.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tHowever, there may be lack of dexterity in older patients and intolerance owing to a foreign body sensation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tSurgical therapy includes\n\n\nIntraocular lens (IOL) implantation: IOL implantation is the best method of correcting aphakia. Calculation of power of an IOL depends upon keratometry (measured with keratometer) of the cornea and axial length of the eyeball (measured with ultrasonography). A patient who needs 12.5 D in apahkic spectacles would need about 21 D of an IOL in posterior chamber of eye. The average magnification due to an IOL in posterior chamber is about 1.5%, compared with the original crystalline lens.

 {"id":21, "name":"Ankyloblepharon", "intro":"Anisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic.\n\n\tThe word anisometropia is derived from the Greek words anisos (unequal), metron (measure), and ops (vision).\n\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.\n\n\tThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).\n\n\tAnisometropia due to refractive myopia or hypermetropia is known as refractive anisometropia and that due to axial ametropia is known as axial anisometropia. Anisometropia due to difference in refractive error along one meridian only is called meridional anisometropia.\n\n\tIn myopic anisometropia, one expects the distance visual acuity in each eye to be lower than normal, the more myopic eye having the poorer visual acuity. However, when the amount of myopia in the less myopic eye is small (minus 0.25 or 0.50 D), the visual acuity in that eye is sufficiently good so that the patient may not be aware of the problem, even if the visual acuity in the more myopic eye is quite poor.\n\n\tIn hypermetropic anisometropia, the visual acuity of both eyes is relatively good as long as the patient has sufficient accommodation. \u00a0\n\n\tIn myopic anisometropia, hypermetropic anisometropia and antimetropia, the individual may not have complaint of asthenopia (eyestrain) and the anisometropia may be discovered during routine eye examination only. However, some cases of hypermetropic anisometropia may have asthenopia due to their inability to focus simultaneously.\n\n\tBecause both the eyes accommodate equally, an uncorrected anisometrope has the problem of never having sharply focused image on both retinas at the same time. For example, a person with 0.25 D of myopia in one eye and 3 D of myopia in other eye will have a sharp focus for one eye for objects at a distance of 4 meters and a sharp focus for the other eye for objects at a distance of 33 cm. Due to this, the person uses less myopic eye for distance vision and the more myopic eye for near vision. Although stereopsis (binocular depth perception) is poor, such individuals have an advantage in later years because bifocal reading glasses may not be required.\n\n\tOn the other hand, a person having 0.25 D of hypermetropia in one eye and 3 D of hypermetropia in the other eye has more severe difficulty. The less hypermetropic eye is used for distance vision requiring 0.25 D of accommodation only. However, more hypermetropic eye requires 3 D of accommodation for distance and 5.50 D of accommodation for a reading distance of 40 cm. Therefore, less hypermetropic eye never has a sharply focused image. It may lead to anisometropic amblyopia (non correctable visual acuity without an obvious cause) in early life.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

Absolute anisometropia: In this condition, refractive power of the two eyes is not equal.\n\n\tThis is further divided into\n\n\nSimple anisometropia: In this type one eye is normal and the other eye is hypermetropic or myopic.\n\nCompound anisometropia: In this both eyes are ametropic i.e. either myopic or hypermetropic.\n\nMixed anisometropia: In this both eyes are ametropic with one being myopic and the other being hypermetropic. This is also called antimetropia.\n\nSimple astigmatic anisometropia: In this type one eye is emmetropic and the other has simple astigmatism either myopic or hypermetropic.\n\nCompound astigmatic anisometropia: Both eyes are astigmatic with unequal degree.\n\n\nII. Relative anisometropia: It is that refractive anomaly in which although the total refraction of the two eyes is nearly equal, the component elements in each show relatively large differences. Therefore, total refraction of the two eyes may be equal, but the axial length may be different. This produces clear retinal image with aniseikonia (different size of retinal images).\n\nVisual status in anisometropia: \n\n\tThere are various visual possibilities\n\n\nBinocular single vision: Binocular vision is possible in small degrees of anisometropia. A difference of more than 5 D between two eyes causes loss of binocularity. Since accommodation is distributed equally between two eyes and is not dissociated, the image of one eye is blurred always. It produces symptoms of accommodative asthenopia.\n\nAmblyopia: If visual acuity is not good and the hypermetropia is high, then this eye may be excluded from vision and the eye develops amblyopia. Thus these patients have uniocular vision in the unaffected eye.\n\nAlternating vision: When there is high anisometropia with good visual acuity in eyes, then the patient develops habit of using hypermetropic eye for distance and the myopic eye for near vision. These patients are usually comfortable and do not seek any medical help for vision correction.\n\nStrabismus: The eye with the visual defect become convergent and the child may develop concomitant convergent squint.\n\n\nTests for binocular vision:\n\n\tBinocular vision may be assessed by using FRIEND test or Worth\u2019s four-dot test.\n\nI. FRIEND test: In this test, alternate letters are green and red in colour. Letters F, I and N are in green colour and the letters R, E and D are in red colour. This is available in Snellen\u2019s distance vision chart. Patient is seated 6 meters from the Snellen\u2019s chart and wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient then reads letters FRIEND on Snellen\u2019s chart. Result is interpreted as\n\n\nPatient reads all letters as FRIEND: In the presence of binocular single vision, the patient reads all letters as FRIEND at once.\n\nPatient reads either green FIN letters or red RED letters: In amblyopia or uniocular vision, patient reads either green letters or red letters i.e. it is read persistently either as FIN (read with left eye) or RED (read with right eye).\n\nPatient reads sometimes FIN and RED: In alternate vision, patient reads sometimes FIN and RED at other times.\n\n\nII. Worth\u2019s four-dot test: Patient wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient views Snellen\u2019s distance vision chart having four dots of light viz. one red, two green and one white. The results are interpreted as\n\n\nPatient sees all the four lights: When all the four lights are seen in the absence of manifest squint, patient has normal binocular single vision. Patient sees four lights also in the presence of a manifest squint with abnormal retinal correspondence.\n\nPatient sees two red lights only: This indicates suppression of vision in the left eye.\n\nPatient sees three green lights only: This indicates suppression of vision in the right eye.\n\nPatient sees three green lights and two red lights alternately: This indicates presence of alternating suppression of vision.\n\nPatient sees three green lights and two red lights (five lights): This indicates the presence of diplopia in patient.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical therapy\n\n\tPrincipal factors which influence optical correction of anisometropia are aniseikonia and amblyopia.

Therefore, reduced optical correction of the more ametropic eye may be required even with compromised visual acuity.\n\n\t\tLarge differences in refraction may require contact lenses, and are prescribed if\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aniseikonia is present.

A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort.\n\nContact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia.

Photorefractive surgery, both photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), is being used increasingly to correct anisometropia.\n\nRemoval of crystalline lens: Crystalline lens may be removed for unilateral high myopia.\n\nPhakic IOL: Intraocular lens may be implanted without removing the crystalline lens.\n\nClear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL: Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL, may be done.

 {"id":22, "name":"Abnormal uterine bleeding", "intro":"Aniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses. \u00a0It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and/or shape between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is usually considered clinically significant when the image size difference is greater than 4 percent, but many patients experience distortions in spatial perception and/or uncomfortable binocular vision with differences as small as 2 percent.\n\n\tThe term \u2018aniseikonia\u2019 was introduced by Lancaster in 1938 to refer to a difference between two eyes in the perceived size of an object. The word aniseikonia originates from the Greek words aniso (unequal) and eikon (image).\n\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina.

This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).\n\nOptical aniseikonia denotes aniseikonia due to a physically measured difference in the sizes of the retinal images that typically arises in uncorrected axial anisometropia or in corrected refractive anisometropia. Little if any difference in the size of the image occurs with corrected axial anisometropia or with uncorrected refractive anisometropia. Aniseikonia may occur in people for whom the images in the two eyes are equal in size, in which case it must be due to non-optical causes. This condition is referred as neural aniseikonia.\n\n\tAniseikonia is the cause of curable ocular discomfort suffered by small but not insignificant number of people.\n\nMost commonly aniseikonia occur following eye surgery. An eye with significant refractive error as in aphakia (when operated for cataract) or refractive surgery, the refractive error is minimised in operated eye. But the other eye still requires a strong corrective lens for clear vision. Similarly, when both eyes are operated for cataract surgery but intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia) is used in one or both eyes, also produces aniseikonia.\n\nReferences\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

Binocular single vision may be restored in favourable cases.\n\n\t- There is no improvement of visual acuity in anisometropic amblyopia in children with a difference in refraction of 4 D or above.\n\n\t- Trial contact lenses show a better binocular function as compared to spectacles.\n\n\n\t\tPatients with marked anisometropic myopia may show hypophoria in primary position with a head tilt to the side of more myopic eye to maintain a comfortable binocular single vision (the \u2018heavy eye\u2019 phenomenon).\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tMedical therapy includes\n\n\nSpectacles: The corrective glasses may be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4 D in two eyes. A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort.\n\nContact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia. These are more useful in young children with high anisometropia, who may become amblyopic in more ametropic eye.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy\n\n\tThis is the preferred mode of treatment.\n\n\tSurgical therapy includes\n\n\nIntraocular lens implantation: Intraocular lens may be implanted for uniocular aphakia.\n\nRefractive corneal surgery: Refractive corneal surgery (refractive laser) may be done for unilateral myopia, astigmatism and hypermetropia. Photorefractive surgery, both photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), is increasingly being used.\n\nRemoval of crystalline lens: Crystalline lens may be removed for unilateral high myopia.\n\nPhakic IOL: Intraocular lens may be implanted without removing the crystalline lens.\n\nClear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL: Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL, may be done. Piggyback IOL means two IOLs are placed in the eye, one on top of the other. This is done if the biometry is +40 D and one does not have a lens of that power to implant.\n\n\n\tRetinal reasons for aniseikonia are treated according to the cause.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":23, "name":"Acquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid", "intro":"Asbestos-related diseases \u00a0\n\n\tAsbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals which are commercially used for insulation in buildings and as an ingredient in a number of products such as roofing tiles, water supply lines, and fire blankets, as well as clutches and brake linings, gaskets, and pads for automobiles. Asbestos causes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases in humans.\n\n\tAll forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite) are in use because of their extraordinary tensile strength, poor heat conduction, and relative resistance to chemical attack. Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure.\n\n\tAll forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos (including chrysotile) causes cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura.\n\n\tExposure to asbestos occurs through inhalation of fibers in air in the working environment, ambient air in the vicinity of point sources such as factories handling asbestos, or indoor air in housing and buildings containing friable asbestos materials.\n\n\tAccording to World Health Organization estimates about 125 million people in the world are exposed to asbestos at the workplace. At least 107000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposures. Approximately half of the deaths from occupational cancer are estimated to be caused by asbestos. In addition, it is estimated that several thousand deaths annually can be attributed to exposure to asbestos in the home.\n\n\tIt has also been shown that co-exposure to tobacco smoke and asbestos fibers substantially increases the risk for lung cancer and the heavier the smoking, the greater the risk.\n\n\tAsbestos is still widely used in Asian countries. Asbestos deposits are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. In India, the domestic consumption of asbestos is 1.25 lakh tones annually, out of which more than a 1.0 lakh tonnes is being imported. Significant occupational exposure to asbestos occurs mainly in asbestos cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling. National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH), Ahmedabad, has carried out environmental and epidemiological studies in cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling with the following observations-\n\n\n\t\tThe prevalence of asbestosis in four cement factories (Ahmadabad, Hyderabad, Coimbatore and Mumbai) varied from 3% to 5%.\n\n\t\tIn asbestos textile industry prevalence of asbestosis was 9% in workers having less than 10 years exposure, in contrast to the reported average duration of over 20 years. Exposure to asbestos fibers is quite high in these industries (216-418 fibers/ml as compare to permissible limit of 2 fibers /ml).\n\n\t\tThe overall prevalence of asbestosis in mining and milling units was 3% and 21% respectively. In asbestos mines at two locations, the air borne fiber levels were within permissible limits. The average fiber levels in milling units were between 45 fibers/ml -244 fibers/ml.\n\n\n\tThe burden of asbestos-related diseases is still rising, even in countries that banned the use of asbestos in the early 1990s. Because of the long latency periods attached to the asbestos related diseases, stopping the use of asbestos now will result in a decrease in the number of asbestos-related deaths only after a number of decades. There is no safe use of asbestos and no safe limits set by WHO, ILO (International labour organization).\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets\n\nwww.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health\n\nwww.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health/Elimination_asbestos-related_diseases\n\nwww.nioh.org/projects/asbestosis.\n\nwww.asbestos.com/occupations/\n\nwww.ijird.com/index.php/ijird/article\n\n\tPark\u2019s Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine, 22nd Edition, Page No 752.", "symtoms":"Repeated or prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers may cause asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), pleural plaques, thickening and pleural effusion.

Friable asbestos materials continue to give rise to exposure during maintenance, alteration, removal and demolition. Exposure can also occur as a consequence of natural disasters causing damage to buildings.\n\n\tAsbestos can enter both in ground and surface water from natural and anthropogenic (changes in nature by people) sources. Soil can also contain asbestos through natural and anthropogenic (disposal of asbestos containing wastes in landfill) sources.\n\nOccupational exposure -The highest levels of exposure occur during repackaging of asbestos containers, mixing with other raw materials and dry cutting of asbestos-containing products with abrasive tools. Exposure can also occur during installation and use of asbestos-containing products and maintenance of vehicles.\n\nExposure of the general population- Inhalation and ingestion are the primary routes of exposure to asbestos. Inhalation of asbestos fibers from outdoor air and to a lesser degree in indoor air is the primary route of exposure for the non- smoking general population (white collar workers within the asbestos industry, individuals living in the vicinity of asbestos mines). Exposure may also occur via ingestion of drinking water which has been contaminated with the asbestos.\n\n\tFamilies of asbestos workers may be exposed via contact with fibers carried home on hair or on clothing.

 {"id":24, "name":"Anaemia during pregnancy (Maternal anemia)", "intro":"Amblyopia is often defined as a difference in visual acuity of two lines or more on Snellen or equivalent chart in a child with, otherwise, healthy eyes. Amblyopia may be present any time visual acuity is reduced, and the reduction of acuity cannot be explained by findings on clinical examination, even if the difference is even one line only.\n\n\tThe term amblyopia is derived from Greek word (amblys means dull and ops means eye), which literally means dullness of vision. Von Noorden defined amblyopia as a \u2018decrease of visual acuity in one eye when caused by abnormal binocular interaction or occurring in one or both eyes as a result of patterned vision deprivation during immaturity, for which no cause can be detected during the physical examination of the eye(s) at which in appropriate cases is reversible by therapeutic measures\u2019.\n\n\tAmblyopia is a functional reduction in the visual acuity of an eye caused by disuse during critical period of visual development. The mechanism of vision loss is not known, but it is thought to originate in the visual cortex. Amblyopia results in reduced visual acuity, binocularity, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity. Fusion and stereopsis, the central formation of three dimensional images, are dependent upon receiving clear images from each eye simultaneously.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

Organic amblyopia is a term used to describe visual impairment due to obvious or non obvious ocular pathology, commonly affecting retina or optic nerve. Examples of organic amblyopia are optic nerve hypoplasia, optic atrophy and foveal hypoplasia. Functional amblyopia may occur along with organic amblyopia. Functional amblyopia normally occurs in an eye that is anatomically normal.\n\n\tFunctional amblyopia is caused by either form of vision deprivation or abnormal binocular interaction. Form- vision deprivation occurs due to conditions that obstruct the visual axis such as cataract, corneal opacity, vitreous haemorrhage, or severe ptosis, but it may also be produced by severe anisometropia. Abnormal binocular interaction refers to the condition in which the image projected onto the fovea of each eye is dissimilar enough to preclude fusion, thus prompting suppression and ultimately amblyopia of the suppressed eye. While strabismus may be the most obvious cause of abnormal binocular interaction, unilateral opacity of the media and anisometropia may participate in this mechanism as well.\n\nAetiological classification: This is the most commonly used classification and has high prognostic value. It is classified as\n\n\nStrabismic amblyopia: Frequently amblyopia is associated with strabismus. Often it may not be known with certainty whether amblyopia is the consequence or the cause of strabismus. Constant tropias (squint) are most commonly associated with amblyopia unlike intermittent tropias (intermittent exotropia). This type of amblyopia is usually unilateral and the severity is not related with the degree of strabismus.\n\nRefractive amblyopia: Ametropia is one of the most important causes of uni- and bilateral amblyopia.\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Isoametropic amblyopia: This is related to the age. It is said that high refractive errors either bilateral or unilateral would not affect the development of binocularity and visual acuity before the first year of life. Otherwise, refractive errors not corrected after one year of age are related with a high degree of uni- and bilateral decrease of vision.\n\n\tIn hypermetropia, insufficient accommodative effort which inadequately focuses the images on retina may produce amblyopia. In high myopia, objects close to the patient tend to be in focus and amblyopia is uncommon.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anisometropic amblyopia: It is likely to occur because the amount of accommodation necessary to focus the image in the less hypermetropic eye is utilised. Therefore, more hypermetropic eye receives blurred image. When the difference in hypermetropia exceeds two dioptres, amblyopia may be present. Some cases even with less amount of difference may develop amblyopia.\n\n\tIn anisomyopia, more myopic eye may be used for near vision and the less myopic for distance vision. It causes sharp image to be present in both the eyes. Amblyopia is unusual when myopia does not exceed five dioptres.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Meridional amblyopia: Meridional amblyopia is due to astigmatism producing defocused images with specific orientation. Astigmatism appears to be an important factor for amblyopia, during first year of life.\n\n\nStimulus deprivation amblyopia: This produces most severe amblyopia. Nystagmus usually presents with amblyopia during first three months of life. Ptosis, congenital cataract, corneal opacity and eye occlusion also produces stimulus deprivation amblyopia. Unilateral cases are more amblyogenic. In general, early the treatment, better is the result. Congenital cataract is the leading cause of deprivation amblyopia and need quick diagnosis.\n\nIdiopathic amblyopia: In some patients no amblyogenic factor is detected. It is postulated that this may be due to some amblyogenic factor, such as transient anisometropia in infancy, which might have disappeared with advancing age.\n\nOcclusion amblyopia: Occlusion amblyopia is an iatrogenic condition caused by therapeutic patching of the eye with normal vision. It usually occurs in the sound eye as a result of amblyopia treatment of other eye, but it is occasionally seen in young children after occlusion therapy to treat ocular pathology, such as corneal abrasion.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of amblyopia is based mainly on measurement of visual acuity.\n\n\tA diagnosis of amblyopia requires complete eye examination to rule out any organic cause as well as correct refractive error under cycloplegia. Clinically an organic cause is suspected in addition to functional amblyopia, if treatment improves vision up to certain level only. Amblyopia may be mimicked by any defect in the afferent visual system. Optic nerve glioma is the most important suspected pathology.\n\nVisual acuity measurement \n\n\tSubjective and objective methods to test visual acuity have been proposed.\n\n\nOptical grating: The different stimuli consist of repetitive gratings of predictable and precise luminance variations. Sinusoidal and square- wave gratings are some other forms to test visual acuity.\n\nOptokinetic nystagmus: The primary use of optokinetic nystagmus is a rapid screen for the gross integrity of the visual system. Acuity may be measured as the finest grating that elicits a visible optokinetic nystagmus when different sizes of stripes are used.\n\nPreferential looking test: It is based on the principle that infants tend to fixate a pattern stimulus rather than a homogeneous field. With this, inter-ocular acuity may be detected in children less than one year of age. Acuity is estimated by selecting the spatial frequency of the stripe that was fixed longer than the homogeneous field by 75% of the infants at a given age.\n\nVisually evoked potential: Visually evoked potential is a summed cortical response to changes in some characteristics of a visual stimulus. The visual stimulus may be either a simple flash or a more complex pattern. All these techniques are complementary to evaluate vision in children who are unable to complete recognition acuity tests.\n\nVisuscope: Visuscope is a type of direct ophthalmoscope that projects a focused image onto the retina so that the examiner can see the image on the retina. First the image is projected onto the parafoveal retina, and then the patient is asked to look at the image. Patient with central fixation re-fixates to place the image on fovea again. However, with eccentric fixation, the patient views with the parafoveal retinal area and show a wandering unsteady fixation.", "management":"Early management of amblyopia is critical for best visual acuity results. The basic strategy for treating amblyopia is to first provide a clear retinal image, and then correct ocular dominance if ocular dominance is present, as early as possible during the period of visual plasticity (birth to eight years of life).\n\nI. Clear retinal image:\n\n\tPatients with bilateral hypermetropia (> + 5.00 D) should receive the full hypermetropic correction, as amblyopic eyes do not fully accommodate. Patients who are given partial correction of their high hypermetropia often shows very slow or no improvement in their amblyopia. Prescribe full astigmatic correction to provide a clear retinal image.\n\nII. Correct ocular dominance\n\n\tCorrection of ocular dominance is accomplished by forcing fixation to the amblyopic eye through patching or blurring the vision of the sound eye by\n\n\nOcclusion: Patching or occlusion therapy is based on covering the sound eye to stimulate amblyopic eye for vision. Part- time occlusion is preferred because this helps to preserve fusion.\n\nPenalisation: Penalisation is a method for blurring the sound eye to force fixation to the amblyopic eye. Penalisation works if fixation is switched from sound eye to the amblyopic eye.\n\nOcclusive contact lens: Occlusive contact lens may be used to treat amblyopia. This should be used as a last resort since many patients suffer complications of eye.\n\nBilateral light occlusion: A preventive treatment of amblyopia may be the use of bilateral light occlusion. It is shown that this bilateral occlusion prolongs the sensitive period of visual development.\n\nLevodopa/ carbidopa in the treatment of amblyopia: Levodopa is a precursor for the catecholamine dopamine, neuro- transmitter/ modulator known to influence receptive fields.\n\nPleoptics: Pleoptics is a method of treating eccentric fixation associated with dense amblyopia. A bright light temporarily saturates the photoreceptors surrounding the fovea, which eliminates vision from the eccentric fixation point and forces fixation to the fovea.\n\nActive stimulation: Active stimulation of the amblyopic eye as a way to improve vision in the amblyopic eye has been suggested.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis\n\n\tThe prognosis of amblyopia depends upon the age of the patient, severity of amblyopia, and type of amblyopia. The earlier the amblyopia occurs and longer it remains untreated, the worse is the prognosis. In general, bilateral amblyopia responds better than unilateral amblyopia, and myopic anisometropic amblyopia responds better than hypermetropic anisometropic amblyopia.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Workers can protect themselves in work place by taking various measures;\n\n\nExposure by Inhalation can be prevented by use of breathing protection measures, fresh air and rest.\n\nSkin exposure can be prevented by use of protective gloves, protective clothing.\u00a0Remove contaminated clothes.

The eyelids maintain their integrity and identity. The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal/syndromic conditions.\n\n\tAnkyloblepharon may be complete, partial, or interrupted. In interrupted form, known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA), epithelial bands are present between the lower and upper eyelids. These fine extensile cords attaching lower and upper eyelids may be single or multiple. The cords decrease the palpebral fissure height and reduce excursion of eyelids. It is reported in trisomy 18. In autosomal dominant Hay-Well\u2019s syndrome, ankyloblepharon may be associated with ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate.

Lateral canthal angle may be displaced downward giving an anti-mongoloid appearance to the palpebral fissure. Lateral canthal tendon is lax or not developed so that there is significant laxity of the lower eyelids.\n\n\tIn ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, one or more narrow epithelial strands connect the central part of lower and upper eyelid margins.

 {"id":26, "name":"Acute encephalitis syndrome", "intro":"Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common problem among (non-pregnant) women in the reproductive age. Formerly, it was known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). AUB is responsible for significant health problem and social embarrassment and it is one of the common reasons women seek health care. It has a significant impact on the quality of life for the women. Women with abnormal bleeding have a lower quality of life than the general female population.\n\n\tThe normal length of the menstrual cycle is normally between 24 days and 38days. A normal menstrual period generally lasts up to 8days. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time. (Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes).\n\n\tAUB leads to loss of productivity and may result in surgical interventions. AUB is reported to occur in 9 to 14% women between menarche and menopause. The prevalence varies in each country. In India, the reported prevalence of AUB is around 17.9%.\n\n\tThe International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Menstrual Disorders Working Group has proposed to abandon the use of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), while continue to use the terms abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). HMB includes menometrorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding during menstrual periods and at irregular intervals), metrorrhagia (bleeding at irregular intervals) and polymenorrhoea (more frequent periods). HMB is defined as \u201cexcessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the woman's physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone, or in combination with other symptoms.\n\n\tTo standardize nomenclature of AUB, a new system known by the acronym PLAM-COEIN, was introduced in 2011 by FIGO. The PALM-COEIN system is based on etiology and pathology of disorder, where PALM describing structural causes(polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia) and COEIN denoting non- structural causes of AUB (coagulopathy; ovulatory disorders; endometrial factors; iatrogenic; and not classified).\n\n\tAbnormal uterine bleeding in women of reproductive age is a manifestation of any of a number of pathologic disorders.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gcpr-on-aub.pdf\n\nwww.figo.org/sites/default/files/uploads/IJGO/papers/AUB%20Classification.pdf\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4371378/\n\nwww.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg44/evidence/full-guideline-195071293\n\nwww.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Abnormal-Uterine-Bleeding\n\nwww.alliedacademies.org/articles/clinicopathological-study-of-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-north-indian-patients.pdf\n\nwww.bmj.com/content/334/7603/1110\n\nhsogc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/giu292CPG1305E1.pdf", "symtoms":"Abnormal uterine bleeding may present as any of the following symptoms-\n\n\n\t\tBleeding or spotting between periods\n\n\t\tHeavy bleeding during period\n\n\t\tMenstrual cycles that are longer than 38 days or shorter than 24 days\n\n\t\tIrregular periods in which cycle length varies by more than 7-9 days\n\n\t\tBleeding or spotting after sex\n\n\t\tBleeding after menopause\n\n\n\t(Normal menstrual cycle- The normal length of the\u00a0menstrual cycle\u00a0is between 24 days and 38 days.

These are usually benign but some may be precancerous or cancerous.\n\n\t\u00a0Adenomyosis (AUB-A) - This is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows in to the muscle wall of the uterus ( myometrium). It may lead to heavy or longer-than-usual menstrual bleeding, as well as pain during menstrual cycle.\n\nLeiomyoma (AUB-L) - These are benign fibromuscular tumors of the myometrium.

Prevalence and clinical impact of disorders of systemic hemostasis, or coagulopathies\u00a0(AUB-C) (one of which, von Willebrand\u00a0disease), can be identified in about 13% of women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).\n\nOvulatory dysfunction-Disorders of ovulation may present as different menstrual abnormalities ranging from amenorrhea (absence of periods), extremely light and infrequent bleeding, to unpredictable heavy menstrual bleeding. Ovulatory disorders may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, mental stress, obesity, anorexia, weight loss, extreme exercise. Ovulatory disorders frequently occur at the extremes of reproductive age: adolescence and the perimenopause.

It decreases the woman\u2019s reserve to tolerate bleeding either during or after child birth and makes prone to infections. Anaemia during pregnancy also has been associated with increased risk of intra uterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight (LBW) and maternal and child mortality.\n\n\tWorld Health Organization (WHO)/World Health Statistics data shows that 40.1% of pregnant women worldwide were anemic in 2016. \u00a0The condition is prominent in Southeast Asian countries where about half of all global maternal deaths are due to anemia and India contributes to about 80% of the maternal death due to anaemia in South Asia. There is marginally decrease in prevalence of anemia in pregnant women in India from 58% in NFHS-3 (National Family Health Survey-2005-06) to 50 % in NFHS-4 survey (2015-16).\n\n\tAmong the various causes of anaemia in women, iron deficiency is the most common cause, primarily due to their recurrent menstrual loss and secondary due to poor supply of iron in the diet. During pregnancy anemia is common due to increased demand of iron for the growing fetus and placenta; and increased red blood cell mass (with expanded maternal blood volume in the third trimester), which is further aggravated with other factors such as childbearing at an early age, repeated pregnancies, short intervals between pregnancies and poor access to antenatal care and supplementation. Indian Council of Medical Research considers haemoglobin (Hb) level below 10.9 g/dl as cutoff point for anemia during pregnancy.\n\n\tThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has given emphasis to prevent anaemia under RMNCH+A services. National Health Policy 2017 also addressed malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies interventions. \u201cNational Iron Plus Initiative\u201d launched in 2013 is a comprehensive strategy to combat the public health challenge of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) prevalent across the life cycle.\n\n\tNational Nutrition Mission has been setup under the oversight of the Ministry of Women and Child Development with the aim to reduce anaemia among young children, adolescent girls and women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) by one third of NFHS-4 levels by 2022.\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/77770/9789241501996\n\nwww.fogsi.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gcpr-recommendation-ida.pdf\n\nwww.nrhmtn.gov.in/guideline/RGPMA.pdf\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257335/\n\nrchiips.org/NFHS/pdf/NFHS4/India.pdf\n\npdfs.semanticscholar.org/07bb/26a03551d538a24b0ff8544881194a2d8312.pdf\n\nwww.nrhmhp.gov.in/sites/default/files/files/Iron\n\n164.100.117.97/WriteReadData/userfiles/BG%20Note%20on%20NNM%20and%20BBBP.pdf\n\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sh.prg.anem\n\nhttp://www.ijcmph.com/index.php/ijcmph/article/view/657", "symtoms":"Early symptoms of anemia are usually nonspecific such as fatigue, weakness, light-headedness, mild dyspnea during exertion.\n\n\tOther symptoms and signs may include pallor of the eyelids, tongue, nail beds, and palms, spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia), and oedema.\n\n\tThe restless leg syndrome during pregnancy and pica (an eating disorder to lick or eat non-food items, such as gypsum, chalk, soil, ice or paper) are also prevalent symptoms in pregnant women.\n\n\tTachycardia, hypotension and even congestive cardiac failure can occur in severe cases.\n\n\tAnemia increases risk of preterm delivery.

There is substantial increase in iron requirement during pregnancy that ranges from 0.8mg per day in the first trimester to 7.5mg per day in the third trimester.\n\n\tIDA occurs when the body doesn\u2019t have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of haemoglobin. Low bio-availability of iron in food, inadequate intake of iron rich food and iron enhancers, and excess consumption of iron inhibitors can contribute to iron deficiency anemia.\n\nFolate deficiency anaemia- Folate is a type of B vitamin needs to produce new cells including healthy red blood cells. During pregnancy, women need extra folate and when they don\u2019t get enough from diet, it results in to anemia. Folate deficiency can directly contribute to certain types of birth defects such as neural tube abnormalities (spina bifida). A diet low in fresh fruits, vegetables, and fortified cereals is the main cause of folate deficiency.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency can also lead to anaemia during pregnancy which may contribute to birth defects such as neural tube abnormalities, and could lead to preterm labor. Folate deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency can often be found together.\n\nHelminthic infestation (such as hookworm) is associated with IDA due to chronic intestinal blood loss.\n\nMalaria causes anaemia by rupturing RBCs and suppressing production of RBCs. Malaria in pregnancy increases the risk of maternal anaemia, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, LBW and neonatal deaths.\n\nSickle cell disease and thalassemia are inherited disorders of haemoglobin result in recurrent haemolytic anaemia.\u00a0\n\nInfections: Certain chronic diseases, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases can interfere with the production of RBCs, resulting in chronic anaemia. Kidney failure can also cause anaemia\n\n\tIn developing countries early onset of childbearing, high number of births, short intervals between births, and poor access to antenatal care and iron supplementation also contribute to occurrence of anemia during pregnancy.\n\nReferences-\n\nnhm.gov.in/images/pdf/programmes/wifs/guidelines/\n\nwww.fao.org/tempref/docrep/fao/005/y8346m/y8346m06.pdf", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of anemia during pregnancy is done by the symptoms, clinical signs and investigations.\n\nInvestigations-\n\n\u00a0(a)Hemoglobin estimation (Hb)- Haemoglobin estimation is the most practical method of diagnosing anemia.

In placental abruption some of the bleeding escapes through the cervix causing external haemorrhage and sometimes bleeding is concealed when blood does not escape externally. Placental abruption can occur in up to 5% of pregnancies.\n\n\tThe precise cause of abruption is unknown, but risk factors for placental abruption include: pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, non-vertex presentations, polyhydramnios, advanced maternal age, multiparty, low body mass index (BMI), pregnancy following assisted reproductive techniques, intrauterine infection, premature rupture of membranes, abdominal trauma (both accidental and resulting from domestic violence), smoking, drug misuse (cocaine and amphetamines) during pregnancy and maternal thrombophilia. Bleeding in first trimester also increases the risk of abruption later in the pregnancy.\n\n\tPlacental abruption is mostly diagnosed on ultrasound examination. Though Sonography is not sensitive for the detection of placental abruption but it is highly specific.\n\nPlacenta accrete- When the placenta (or part of the Placenta) invades and is inseparable from the uterine wall, it is called placenta accrete.

As most women start their pregnancy with low iron stores and anaemia, preventive interventions should start early in life specially with adolescent girls and women in child bearing age. Good nutrition is the best way to prevent anemia.\n\n\tNutrition education programmes should be strengthened in the community/ health care facilities with the objective to improve the amount and bioavailability of iron in Indian diet. Family should be made aware about the different plans to meet the requirement of iron rich foods, role of iron inhibitors and enhancers in the diet with changing dietary habits according to various cultural, agricultural and socio-economic environment in the country.\n\n\tPreventive measures include nutrition education about increase iron intake through food-based approaches namely- dietary diversification, food fortification with iron, iron supplementation; and improved health services and sanitation.\n\n\u00a0(i) Diet diversification-\n\n\tWith the diet diversification consumption of iron in the diet can be increased with adopting following measures:\n\n\t(a) Promotion of eating foods rich in iron such as green leafy vegetables, lentils, eggs, nuts and seeds, beans, lean red meat, fruits like banana, melon.\n\n\tSome common sources of iron are- Chickpea (Chana Sag), Spinach (Palak), Amaranth (Kantewali Chaulai), Onion Stalks (Pyaz ki kali), Mustard Leaves (Sarson ka sag), Fenugreek Leaves (Methi), Mint (Pudina), Lentil (Dal), Soyabean, Bengal Gram (Whole Kala chana), Gingelly Seeds (Til), Black Gram Dal, (Urad Dal), Pumpkin (Seethaphal), Plantain Green (Kuchcha Kela), Water Melon (Tarbooz), Mutton (Gosht).\n\n\t(b) By increasing use of enhancers such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in the diet to enhance iron absorption. Some of the rich sources of vitamin C are guava, orange, lemon, cabbage, green leafy vegetables, amla, bell peppers, kiwi, melons.\n\n\t(c) By encouraging the use of a number of common household processing methods such as germination, malting, and fermentation which can enhance iron absorption by increasing the vitamin C content; and by lowering the tannin and phytic acid content, or both.\n\n\t(d) Addition of a small portion of meat, poultry, or fish will increase the total iron content as well as the amount of bio-available iron.\n\n\t(e) To encourage the consumption of tea, coffee, chocolate, or herbal teas at times other than with meals as these substances prevents abortion of iron from the gut.\n\n(ii) Food fortification refers to the addition of micronutrients to processed foods\u00a0so as to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and provide a public health benefit with minimal risk to health.

The duration of visual impairment is brief usually less than fifteen minutes and rarely exceeding thirty minutes. The term Amaurosis fugax has been used not only for monocular condition, but also for the transient loss of vision in both eyes (less common). Most of the patients are affected for about one to five minutes only. Generally, recovery is in the same pattern as the visual loss, although usually more gradual.

Partial impairment presents as ascending or descending curtain or a blind moving sideways across the eye. Visual field defect is complete or partial. It is due to retinal ischaemia, embolisation or arteritis.\n\nType II: It is less rapid in onset and may be associated with loss of contrast vision and photopsiae. It lasts from minutes to hours. Pain may be rarely associated and the recovery is complete. Visual field defect is complete or partial. It is produced due to retinal hypoperfusion and carotid occlusive disease.\n\nType III: It is of abrupt onset and show photopsiae, scintillating sparkles, and is often accompanied by pain.

Episodic attacks of blindness occur as arteriosclerotic plaques progressively narrow the lumen of ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA), leading to reduced pressure and flow in ophthalmic artery. Cholesterol crystals (Hollenhorst plaques) or ulcerating plaque may embolise to ophthalmic or central retinal artery, without causing permanent visual loss.\n\n\tTMB is regarded as one variety of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and should be recognised as a warning sign of impending stroke. Frequency of attacks may vary from several times in a day to once only every few months. Cerebral ischaemia may affect both eyes with ipsilateral hemifield defect.\n\n\tAmaurosis usually occurs in elderly patients over fifty years of age who have vascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, history of smoking, or previous episodes of TIAs.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.\n\n\tPatients present with sudden monocular loss of vision that usually is less than fifteen minutes, and it rarely exceeds thirty minutes. Vision loss may be complete or partial. It is described as a curtain falling down in front of the eye or as a generalised darkening. Patient may experience one to multiple episodes, which usually resolve spontaneously. The attacks may sometimes be associated with ipsilateral cerebral TIA, with contralateral neurological features.\n\n\tSome patients may present with emboli such as cholesterol plaques, which may result in retinal ischaemia. Depending upon the severity of ischaemia, BRA or CRA occlusion may develop.\n\n\tOther group of patients, mainly with ocular ischaemic syndrome, ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion produces hypoperfusion to retinal photoreceptors with resultant blurring or diminution of vision. Patients with ocular ischaemic syndrome present with transient blurring of vision. Vision deteriorates with progression of disease. Episcleral vessels may show congestion and there may be mild anterior chamber inflammation. Fundus examination usually shows dilated and tortuous retinal veins with narrowed arterioles and dot/blot haemorrhages. Persistent hypoperfusion may lead to development of neovascularisation in iris, angle of anterior chamber, optic disc, and retina.\n\n\tThe visual loss from migraine may last from few seconds to an hour.

This nerve has the longest intracranial course amongst all the cranial nerves. A palsy affecting this nerve alone is less common. Usually, seventh (CN VII or facial) and eighth (CN VIII or vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves are also affected along with it, which signals a central cause.\n\n\tChildren are more likely to be affected by a tumour, and older people are more likely to have vasculopathy producing ischaemia.\n\n\tCN VI palsy may present with \u2018false localising sign\u2019, suggesting impingement, when in fact, the causative reason/tumour may be remotely present, or there may not be any detectable reason/tumour.

Blepharospasm reduces while concentrating on a specific task or during sleep.\n\n\tBlepharospasm may be associated with apraxia (loss of ability to perform activity) of eyelid opening i.e. inhibition of proper functioning of levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Apraxia is especially common in parkinsonian disorders.\n\nSecondary blepharospasm: \u00a0\n\n\nMeige\u2019s syndrome: Meige\u2019s syndrome may be associated with facial grimacing due to facial dystonia.\n\nBreughel\u2019s syndrome: Breughel\u2019s syndrome is a dystonia of motor trigeminal nerve which produces widely open mouth. There is paroxysmal hyperpnoea (increased depth of breathing) and upbeating nystagmus.\n\nExtrapyramidal disorders: Patients with extrapyramidal disorders may show other abnormal movements such as tics or cogwheel rigidity of neck and extremities.\n\nReflex blepharospasm: Reflex blepharospasm may occur due to dry eye or ocular irritation from light.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nConditions relieving blepharospasm:\n\n\tThese include:-\n\n\n\t\tSleep.\n\n\t\tRelaxation.\n\n\t\tInferior gaze.\n\n\t\tArtificial tears.\n\n\t\tTraction on eyelids.\n\n\t\tTalking.\n\n\t\tSinging.\n\n\t\tHumming.\n\n\t\tSolving crossword.\n\n\t\tDoing maths.\n\n\t\tSolving puzzles.\n\n\nAnatomic changes associated with long-standing blepharospasm may be:\n\n\nPtosis (drooping of upper eyelid in relation to eyeball): Ptosis of the upper eyelid may occur due to attenuation and disinsertion of levator palpebrae superioris aponeurosis (broad sheetlike tendon).\n\nEyebrow ptosis (drooping): Eyebrow ptosis may result from weakened fascial support caused by longstanding spasm, leading to stretching of fascia.\n\nDermatochalasis: Dermatochalasis is defined as excess of skin in eyelid and is produced by stretching of skin due to blepharospasm.\n\nSkin excoriation: Skin excoriation is produced secondary to manual attempts by patient to open lids.\n\nEntropion: Blepharospasm may lead to spastic entropion.\n\nCanthal tendon abnormalities: Stretching of medial and lateral canthal tendons may produce horizontal lid laxity and therefore, may cause entropion or ectropion of lower lids. Stretching may produce lid fissures also.\n\nPhimosis (short and narrow) of palpebral fissure (opening between eyelids): Bepharospasm may lead to phimosis of palpebral fissure.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nBlepharospasm may be differentiated from conditions like:\n\n\nOcular myokymia: Ocular myokymia is characterised by spontaneous, fine fascicular contractions of orbicularis oculi muscle without muscular weakness or atrophy. Eyelid myokymia is typically unilateral and it commonly involves lower eyelids.\n\nSecondary to meningeal irritation.\n\nFacial tics or Tourette syndrome: Facial tics are repetitive stereotyped movements or vocalisations such as blinking, sniffing, facial movements or tensing of abdominal muscles.\n\nHemifacial spasms (contraction of one side of face): It usually begins as fasciculations of periocular orbicularis and surrounding muscles, which spreads to involve lower facial muscles innervated by facial nerve. Spasms are myoclonic, involuntary, aggravated by stress and may persist during sleep. Hemifacial spasm may lead to facial weakness.\n\nFocal seizures.", "management":"Management should be under medical supervision.\n\n\tCurrently, there is no cure for BEB and the disease frequently progresses despite treatment.\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\nSunglasses: Wearing tinted sunglasses with ultraviolet blocking may help in decreasing painful light sensitivity in those who show significant photosensitivity.\n\nLid hygiene: Lid hygiene may decrease eye irritation.

This appears on lid margins as small oil globules or as collection of waxy material. Tear film is excessively oily and foamy. In severe cases, secretions collect as a frothy discharge at the inner canthus (meibomian foam). This causes burning sensation on first waking in the morning.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Primary meibomitis: Primary meibomitis is characterised by diffuse inflammation around meibomian gland orifices.

Meibomian gland secretions may be turbid and contain particulate debris. Firm pressure on tarsal glands show inspissated secretions.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tObliteration of main meibomian ducts may cause secondary cystic dilatation and formation of chalazion (meibomian cyst). In advanced cases, posterior lid margin may show thickening, rounding, vascularisation and notching.

 {"id":43, "name":"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome", "intro":"Band Shaped Keratopathy (Calcific band keratopathy, or band keratopathy) is a non-specific corneal condition characterised by chronic deposition of calcium salts (principally hydroxyapatite) within the basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s layer and anterior stromal lamellae of the corneal epithelium (leaving remainder of the cornea clear). Initially, corneal degenerative changes begin near the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o\u2019clock position. Calcific band is concentric with the limbus but is separated from it by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval) due to lack of Bowman\u2019s layer at the periphery, or due to buffering action at the limbus. Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity having frosted or ground glass appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. There are numerous holes where corneal nerves penetrate the Bowman\u2019s layer. The disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens as well in its anterior and posterior dimensions, resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Calcium deposits thicken and may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions.\n\n\tBand shaped keratopathy may occur as isolated condition or in association with a variety of disease entities. The corneal involvement is described as band shaped keratopathy because of the band-like distribution of the deposits across the interpalpebral zone. Unlike band shaped keratopathy, calcareous degeneration usually spares the basement and Bowman\u2019s membrane and is characterised by clumps of calcium salts in the superficial and deep stroma.\n\n\tPatients with keratopathy may remain relatively asymptomatic for a considerable length of time in early stages of the disease, as long as the central visual axis of the cornea remains clear. With progression of the disease, there is diminution of visual acuity and pain in the eyes due to disruption of the corneal epithelium.\n\n\tIdentification of corneal and conjunctival degenerations has improved with the use of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemical staining and genetic testing.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.

As such, there are many diseases associated with this condition. Though we tend to think first of conditions such as uveitis and systemic hypercalcaemia, in a recent series the most commonly associated causes of calcific band keratopathy were chronic corneal oedema, phthisis bulbi, and even idiopathic cases.\n\nSystemic disease associations:\n\nHypercalcaemia (elevated serum calcium level) may be due to:\n\n\n\t\tHyperparathyroidism.\n\n\t\tOver treatment for hypoparathyroidism.\n\n\t\tVitamin D intoxication.\n\n\t\tSarcoidosis.\n\n\t\tMultiple myeloma.\n\n\t\tPaget\u2019s disease.\n\n\t\tMilk-alkali syndrome.\n\n\t\tEnd stage renal disease: In end-stage renal disease, elevation of either serum calcium, phosphate, or both may disrupt the equilibrium towards precipitation.\n\n\t\tHypophosphatasia: Hypophosphatasia, an inborn error of metabolism involving decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and resultant hypercalcaemia (less common).\n\n\t\tTumoral calcinosis: Tumoral calcinosis, a rare syndrome characterised by periarticular calcium deposition, has also been reported as a systemic association (less common).\n\n\n\tIn some cases, reversal of serum hypercalcaemia through treatment of the underlying disease will lead to spontaneous resolution of band keratopathy within a few months.\n\nHyperuricaemia: \u00a0Hyperuricaemia may lead to band keratopathy and is differentiated based on clinical history, the golden-brown colour on examination, and elevated uric acid levels.\n\nHeredity: Primary hereditary band keratopathy.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nAssociation with chronic ocular conditions:\n\n\tNumerous chronic ocular conditions may similarly predispose to the development of calcific band keratopathy such as:\n\n\n\t\tUveitis (chronic iritis in particular, affiliated with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis). In general, the severity of band keratopathy relates directly to the duration of ocular inflammation, though the specific details of the cause and effect relationship between uveitis and corneal mineralisation remains poorly understood.\n\n\t\tChronic ocular inflammation.\n\n\t\tAbsolute glaucoma.\n\n\t\tChronic corneal oedema.\n\n\t\tPhthisis bulbi.\n\n\t\tInterstitial keratitis.\n\n\t\tOcular toxicity: Whereas band keratopathy typically develops over months to years, several of these iatrogenic aetiologies demonstrate rapid onset of the corneal changes. Ocular toxicity may be due to:\n\n\n\t- Mercurial preservatives: Degenerative calcium deposition associated with chronic damage from mercurial preservatives in many ophthalmic preparations (e.g. phenyl-mercuric nitrate or thiomersal).\n\n\t- Topical steroid-phosphate preparations.\n\n\t- Intraocular use of silicone oil.\n\n\t- Intraocular use of sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulphate: Intraocular use of sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulphate during routine cataract extraction.\n\n\tThe causes of band shaped keratopathy can be broadly divided into six categories:\n\n\nChronic inflammation: Chronic keratitis, chronic uveitis of any cause and ocular trauma, along with its accompanying chronic Inflammation, are the most common ocular causes of band shaped keratopathy.\n\nMercurial preservatives: Degenerative calcium deposition associated with chronic damage from mercurial preservatives in many ophthalmic preparations viz. long-term use of phenyl-mercuric nitrate preserved miotic therapy,or thiomersal containing artificial tears used for severe dry eye.\n\nHypercalcaemia: Hypercalcaemia secondary to milk alkali syndrome, vitamin D toxicity, sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism, lytic lesions affecting the bones, and other systemic diseases.\n\nRaised serum phosphorus levels: Chronic renal failure, uraemia, or other conditions, that may cause a rise in serum phosphorus levels.\n\nHeredity: Primary hereditary band keratopathy.\n\nSilicone oil instillation in an aphakic eye.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPathogenesis:\n\n\tSince its first description by Dixon in 1848, much remains elusive regarding the exact pathogenesis of Band keratopathy. It is not clear why the disease typically starts at the limbus with an intervening clear space.\n\n\tThe principal calcium salt deposited in band keratopathy, hydroxyapatite, is a complex crystal composed primarily of calcium and phosphate. The solubility of calcium phosphate in organic tissues in general is quite low and this product exists in a near supersaturated state in blood and interstitial tissue. Disruption of this equilibrium with resultant precipitation of calcium phosphate may readily occur with:\n\n\n\t\tAn increase in pH\n\n\t\tIncrease in local concentration of either ion\n\n\t\tAbrupt loss of solvent (e.g. evaporative loss of aqueous tear layer) or\n\n\t\tAppearance of calcium phosphate crystal nucleus in near supersaturated tissue.\n\n\n\tIt is surmised that hypercalcaemia alone was likely not sufficient to produce disease. The suggested possible mechanisms may be:\n\n\nAbnormalities in the transport and mobilisation of calcium in interstitial fluid: Abnormalities in the transport and mobilisation of calcium in interstitial fluid likely drive deposition.\n\nDysfunction of the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1): Dysfunction of the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1) in corneal tissues, sufficiently impairs efflux of bicarbonate from the stroma into the aqueous, thereby raising local pH and predisposing to band keratopathy.\n\nLocalisation of disease to the interpalpebral fissure: Localisation of disease to the interpalpebral fissure, while unrelated to ultraviolet light exposure, may stem from the local effects of evaporative tear film loss.\n\nLoss of carbon dioxide: Loss of carbon dioxide through diffusion at any exposed mucosal surface would raise local pH and thereby promote deposition. Local pH may explain further the propensity for the crystals to deposit in Bowman\u2019s layer and anterior stromal layers, as deeper corneal lamellae have a lower pH due to lactic acid accumulation from anaerobic glycolysis. It is still not clear whether epithelial basement membrane is structurally more conducive to the sudden precipitation of crystalline calcium phosphate.\n\n\n\tSome have asserted that the limbal vasculature may provide a buffer against pH changes, possibly explaining the commonly noted clear interval of uninvolved tissue at the limbus.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of band shaped keratopathy depends upon clinical presentation.\n\nClinical history:\n\n\tPatients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease. Symptomatic patients should be enquired about the severity and duration of symptoms.\n\nHistory of systemic disease: \n\n\n\t\tAny systemic disease causing hyperglycaemia.\n\n\t\tVitamin D intake: Patients should be questioned concerning excessive vitamin D ingestion. Although corneal calcification may be reversible with discontinuation of the vitamin, nephrocalcinosis may still develop.\n\n\t\tJoint pains.\n\n\nHistory of ocular conditions:\n\n\n\t\tOcular symptoms like Irritation, foreign body sensation, watering or diminution of vision.\n\n\t\tAny history suggestive of chronic uveitis or inflammation of eyes.\n\n\t\tUse of topical eye preparations containing steroid phosphate or mercurial preservatives.\n\n\t\tSilicone eye injection.\n\n\t\tLong standing glaucoma.\n\n\nClinical examination:\n\n\tA general medical workup is advisable in patients with systemic association of the disease.\n\n\tExamination of eyes should be carried out under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.\n\n\nBand shaped keratopathy: Initially, corneal degenerative changes are seen concentric with the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o\u2019clock position. Calcific band is separated from the limbus by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval). Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity resembling frosted or ground glass, with \u2018white flecks\u2019 and \u2018clear spots\u2019 interspersed within the band, giving it a \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019 appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. Later, the disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Thickened calcium deposits may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions or epithelial defects.\n\nSigns of chronic inflammation or uveitis. \n\nSigns of long standing glaucoma.\n\nSilicone oil in anterior chamber.\n\n\nHistopathology:\n\n\tThere is deposition of calcium in epithelial basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s layer and anterior stroma which is characteristically seen as sub-epithelial basophilic granular degeneration in band shaped distribution with haematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E stain). With disease progression, large calcium phosphate granules, with traces of sulphur and silicone, become confluent and hyaline deposits may be appreciable between layers of redundant, calcified Bowman\u2019s membrane. Masses of eosinophilic amorphous connective tissue insinuate themselves between the fragments of calcified Bowman\u2019s layer and the overlying epithelium, and there is patchy calcification of the anterior lamellae of the stroma. Calcium is also deposited in areas where there are signs of fibroblastic proliferation.\n\n\tSpecial stains such as alizarin red or von-kossa stain may be used to confirm the findings.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis:\n\n\tLaboratory diagnosis may include tests to diagnose any systemic association of band shaped keratopathy such as:\n\n\n\t\tSerum calcium and phosphate levels.\n\n\t\tSerum parathormone level.\n\n\t\tRenal function tests viz. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.\n\n\t\tAngiotensin converting enzyme levels, x-ray or spiral computerised tomography (CT) scan of chest may be done in suspected cases of sarcoid.\n\n\nImaging studies:\n\n\tImaging studies may help in a search for lytic lesions affecting the bones.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nCalcific band keratopathy should be differentiated from:\n\n\n\t\tPrimary and secondary calcareous degeneration of cornea.\n\n\t\tSpheroidal degeneration or droplet keratopathy which shows band like deposition of hyaline.\n\n\t\tSalzmann nodular degeneration.\n\n\t\tBlood staining of cornea.\n\n\t\tAdvanced anterior basement membrane dystrophy of cornea.\n\n\t\tCalciphylaxis: Calciphylaxis is a condition of induced ocular and systemic hypersensitivity reaction, characterised by calcium deposition in response to specific antigens or agents. For example, it takes place in children with uveitis or in patients given calciferol.\n\n\t\tTopical ciprofloxacin solution particle deposition.\n\n\t\tLimbal stem cell deficiency.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nCalcific band keratopathy versus calcareous degeneration of the cornea: \n\n\tCalcareous degeneration of the cornea usually affects the deep layers as well as the anterior layers. Calcareous degeneration occurs in severely diseased eyes with exposed stroma and vascular compromise or in eyes undergoing multiple operations. It has also been reported in a failed corneal graft. \u00a0Calcareous degeneration of the cornea as seen in seriously injured eyes, phthisis bulbi, and necrotic neoplasms is often accompanied by bone formation elsewhere in the globe. However, primary calcareous degeneration may occur in the absence of systemic disease or calcium metabolic disturbances. The sub epithelial deposition is bilateral, and occasional bouts of irritation may occur.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nTherapeutic goals for the management of band keratopathy are:\n\n\n\t\tTo re-establish normal corneal and limbal topography,\n\n\t\tTo improve visual function if there is potential for it, and\n\n\t\tTo provide symptomatic relief from recurrent erosions and ulcers.\n\n\n\tOcular therapy is indicated only if the patient is symptomatic.\n\n\tDistinguishing local and systemic causes of band shaped keratopathy appropriately outlines treatment options and prognosis for the patient. Removal of the inciting agent in iatrogenic cases or correction of the systemic metabolic disturbance may correct the pathology. Correction of the systemic metabolic disturbance may delay recurrence of the disease after treatment. More so, detection of band keratopathy may occasionally uncover a systemic disease which may be life-threatening.\n\n\tSuperficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy in band keratopathy is usually effective in restoring normal vision. Adverse outcomes such as corneal scarring and vision loss may result from the procedure, but the incidence of such complications is low.\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\nDiet: Diet may be controlled to prevent excessive absorption and serum elevation of calcium associated with vitamin D intake and milk-alkali syndrome as a measure for band keratopathy.\n\nTopical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used as ocular surface lubricants in patients with mild symptoms of discomfort.\n\n\nMedical therapy: \n\n\tAlthough medical therapy is ineffective in treating band keratopathy, underlying systemic conditions associated with elevated levels of calcium and phosphate should be treated to prevent recurrence.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tThe goal of surgery is to remove opaque plaques of calcium, without inducing visually significant stromal scarring.\n\nPrior to surgical management of band keratopathy, it is important to consider:\n\n\n\t\tVisual acuity and future visual potential of the affected eye.\n\n\t\tHealth and visual function of the contra-lateral eye.\n\n\t\tAge, level of cooperation, and family support of patient.\n\n\t\tAssurance to the patient about the surgery.\n\n\t\tAlthough final visual acuity is difficult to predict, patient can expect improved visual function.\n\n\t\tPatient should be prepared for realistic postoperative goals.\n\n\t\tThe probability of recurrent corneal disease always exists. Degeneration may recur even bilaterally following corneal transplantation.\n\n\nCandidates for surgical treatment of band keratopathy are:\n\n\n\t\tPatients with central or paracentral corneal involvement affecting visual function.\n\n\t\tBand keratopathy causing recurrent epithelial erosions with pain.\n\n\nContraindications to surgery:\n\n\n\t\tActive infectious process such as keratitis: Active infectious process such as keratitis, should be treated first.\n\n\t\tGross lid abnormalities and mal-positions: Any gross lid abnormalities and malpositions (e.g. ectropion, entropion, or severe seborrhoeic blepharitis) should be treated beforehand, since it alleviates wound healing complications in the postoperative period.\n\n\t\tHerpes disease: It is advisable to proceed cautiously in patients with known herpetic disease. The surgical trauma and postoperative steroids may reactivate an immunologic response. Perioperative treatment with antivirals acyclovir or valcyclovir is recommended to lessen the risk of disease recurrence.\n\n\nSurgical procedures:\n\nSuperficial debridement: The primary goal of superficial debridement is to clear the visual axis. Superficial debridement of band keratopathy can be performed in a sterile manner in outpatient setting preferably under magnification. Though, any local anaesthesia (e.g. proparacaine) may be used, but cocaine as local anaesthetic facilitates the separation of corneal epithelium from Bowman\u2019s layer. This allows ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) to work more effectively.\n\n\tCorneal epithelium is removed with a blunt spatula from the limbus toward the center (out-to-in or centripetal direction). For difficult areas of calcium, a diamond-burr tip on a Fisch drill may be used.\n\n\tFollowing the procedure, irrigate the eye thoroughly to remove EDTA solution from the conjunctival surface and fornices. Pressure patch is applied after cyclopentolate and topical steroid-antibiotic drops or ointment.\n\nNeodymium- doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet laser (Nd: YAG laser): Calcific band keratopathy can be treated using an Nd: YAG laser. This technique offers advantages of ease of performance, rapid resolution of the patient symptoms, and a smooth corneal surface. It has fallen out of favour with the advent of Argon fluoride excimer laser.\n\nExcimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy: Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy may be used to polish the irregular corneal surface to make it smooth, after the plaque has been removed. Excimer laser should not be used to remove calcium in band keratopathy. Attempt to remove band keratopathy with the excimer laser alone may result in significant irregular corneal astigmatism, since the cornea may be ablated preferentially. Excimer laser does not differentiate between normal corneal tissue and calcified lesions. Further, the excimer laser ablates normal tissues at faster rates than calcified or scarred lesions.\n\nLamellar keratectomy: \u00a0Lamellar keratectomy may be required for more advanced cases.\u00a0 A lamellar keratectomy involving removal of epithelium, Bowman\u2019s layer, and a portion of the anterior stroma, may be performed in cases in which the corneal surface is thickened irregularly and the area of pathology is fairly extensive. It is accomplished with a blade or rotating diamond burr. Any bleeding from associated corneal neovascularisation or interstitial keratitis requires pressure patching or topical vasoconstrictors.\n\n\tAnterior segment \u2013 optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) or Rotating Scheimpflug imaging technique (measures anterior and posterior corneal surfaces) can help measure the extent of the pathology as well as the expected residual stromal bed.\n\nBandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be used following superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy. The bandage contact lenses produce significant relief in pain, protect blink disruption of re-epithelialisation, and provide a scaffold for epithelial migration from the limbus.\n\nAmniotic membrane graft: In recalcitrant cases, \u00a0amniotic membrane graft \u00a0may be applied to cover and promote healing, particularly when delayed epithelialisation is anticipated, such as in patients with chronic ocular surface inflammation or advanced age.\n\n\tAmniotic membrane graft can be used as an adjunct therapy after the calcific deposits are surgically or chemically removed. The amniotic membrane graft should include a thick amniotic membrane with basement membrane to promote wound healing and replace the lost basement membrane and stromal matrix. The amniotic membrane should be placed in a \u2018\u2019 basement membrane down\u201d orientation so that the basement membrane is in direct contact with the underlying stroma. Amniotic membrane graft is secured with sutures or biocompatible fibrin glue. Graft cannot be used as a sole therapy for band keratopathy.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\nPatients with band keratopathy may experience diminution of vision as the deposition progresses across the visual axis. A foreign body sensation and irritation associated with an irregular surface are common symptoms. The ocular discomfort may worsen to the point of becoming disabling, especially as smaller segments of the plaque loosen and become partially mobile. The plaque itself often is visible and of cosmetic concern to the patient and family members.\n\n\tUnless underlying conditions have been addressed, removing the calcium deposits in band keratopathy will be associated with a high incidence of recurrence. In general, however, superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy restores vision and comfort for most of the patients with band keratopathy, with the incidence of adverse outcomes following this procedure being very low.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Maintenance of long-term regimen of eyelid hygiene helps in prevention of outbreaks and recurrent manifestations of systemic disease.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":44, "name":"Chickenpox", "intro":"Burns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.\n\n\tHeat burns occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burn) or a flame (flame burn). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered as burns.\n\n\tAccording to WHO estimates about 265 000 deaths occur each year from fires alone globally, with more deaths from scalds, electrical burns, and other forms of burns for which data are not available. The majority of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with almost half occur in the WHO South-East Asia Region.\n\n\tIn India around 7 million people suffer from burn injuries each year with 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakh people suffer with disability. Burn death rates have been decreasing in high income countries.\n\n\tFemales and males show similar rates for burns in contrast to other injury patterns where rates of injury are higher in males than females. The higher risk for females is associated with open fire cooking, or unsafe cook stoves, loose clothing. Self-directed or interpersonal violence is also a factor for burn injuries.\n\n\tAlong with adult females, children are also vulnerable to burns. Out of 5 burn victims 4 are women and children. Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries and 11th leading cause of death of children aged 1-9 years. Among all people globally, infants have the highest death rates from burns.\n\n\tBurns are also a leading cause of morbidity; millions who survive suffer from lifelong disability and disfigurements with resulting emotional trauma and stigma.\n\n\tBurns are preventable. Increased efforts in prevention and care would lead to significant reduction in burn-related morbidity, mortality and disability.\n\n\tThe National Programme for Prevention, Management and Rehabilitation of Burn Injuries (NPPMRBI) is an initiative by the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India to strengthen the preventive, curative and rehabilitative services for burn victims.\n\nFind more information-\n\nPractical Hand Book on Burns Management, NPPMRBI, MOHFW,GOI\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/violence_injury_prevention\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs365/en/\n\nwww.who.int/topics/burns/en/\n\nnrhm.gov.in/images/pdf/NPPMBI/Operational_Guidelines\n\ndghs.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/file/Practical_handbook\n\ndghs.gov.in/content/1357_3_NationalProgrammePrevention", "symtoms":"Symptoms of burn depend on the depth of the burn. Burns can be divided into three types.\n\nFirst degree or superficial burns involves the upper skin layer. They produce redness (erythema) and pain (tenderness). Blisters are absent. They are typically caused by exposure of the unprotected skin to solar radiation (sun burn) or to brief contact with hot substances, liquids or flash flames (scalds). First-degree burns heal within a week with no permanent changes in skin colour, texture, or thickness.\n\nSecond degree or partial thickness burns affect deeper skin layers. Symptoms are more severe and usually include blisters.\n\n\n\t\tSuperficial second-degree burns take less than three weeks to heal.\n\n\t\tDeep second-degree burns take more than three weeks to close and are likely to form hypertrophic scars.\n\n\nThird degree or full thickness burns involve all skin layers. Skin is white (appears cooked), and there may be no pain in the initial stages. Due to extensive destruction of the skin layers third-degree burn wounds cannot regenerate themselves without grafting.\n\nSigns of inhalational burns-\n\n\n\t\tHistory of burns in closed space\n\n\t\tDeep burns to face, neck, or trunk\n\n\t\tSinged nasal hair\n\n\t\tCarbonaceous sputum ,carbon particles in oropharynx\n\n\t\tChange in voice with hoarseness or harsh cough\n\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43851/1/9789241563574\n\nwww.healthline.com/health/burns#Pictures2\n\nwww.nhs.uk/conditions/Burns-and-scalds/Pages/Introduction\n\nwww.who.int/surgery/publications/Burns_management.pdf", "causes":"Common causes of burns may be classified as thermal or inhalational.\n\nHeat burns occur by:\n\n\nHot liquids (scalds) - Scalds are commonly caused by hot liquids (water, oil), steam from boiling water or heated food. Young children are mostly affected by scalds.\n\nHot solids (Contact burns): Solid objects that are hot can cause contact burns, especially in children. Sources of burns from solid objects include ashes and coal, hot pressing irons, soldering equipment, cooking utensils (frying pans and pots), oven containers, light bulbs, and exhaust pipes.\n\nFlames: Burns can be due to leaking gas pipe or cylinder, accidents from kerosene pressure stove, lighting of crackers during \u201cDiwali\u201d, catching of fires in tents as pandal fires.\n\nChemical burns-These are accidental burns in homes (such as from toilet cleaning agents), or as acid violence attacks (throwing of acid over somebody for seeking revenge and attempts to resolve disputes of love, land or business) and work place accidents.\n\nElectrical burns- Electrical burns are due to exposed \u201clive\u201d wires or short circuits. High tension wires close to homes, play areas and roads can lead to electrical burns.\n\n\nInhalational burns:\n\n\n\t\tInhalational burns are the result of breathing in superheated gases, steam, hot liquids or noxious products of incomplete combustion.\n\n\t\tThey cause thermal injury to the upper airway, irritation or chemical injury to the airways from soot, asphyxiation, and toxicity from carbon monoxide (CO) and other gases such as cyanide and accompany a skin burn in approximately 20% to 35% of cases. \u00a0\n\n\t\tInhalational burns are the most common cause of death among people suffering fire-related burn.\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\tBurns are more common in rural areas and urban poor of low income countries; some of the factors that are of prime concern include:\n\n\n\t\tuse of cooking pots on ground level (floor cooking): toddlers and young children are at increased risk of scald burns as they can easily knock over the pots on the ground level;\n\n\t\t\u00a0use of open wood fires;\n\n\t\twearing of loose fitting cotton clothing (loose chunnis and pallus) can catch fire while cooking on an open fire (a risk factor for women in Asia); or due to faulty habits like use of clothing to hold cooking pot.\n\n\n\tOther risk factors are:\n\n\n\t\tExposure to fire during occupation;\n\n\t\tpoverty, overcrowding(single room houses with kitchen adjacent to bed/play area for children)\n\n\t\tyoung girls performing household work as cooking and care of small children;\n\n\t\tsmoking and alcohol abuse;\n\n\t\tinadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity;\n\n\t\tunderlying medical conditions such as epilepsy, physical and cognitive disabilities.\n\n\n\tBurns can occur in home and workplace. Children and women are usually burned in homes in their kitchens from hot liquids, flames, or from cook stove explosions.

Chemical and electrical burns are deep.\n\n\t\tAge of patients-At extremes of age (infants and older patents) burns are deep because of thinness of skin.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\tb. Examination: The severity of the burn is determined by burned surface area, depth of burn and other considerations. Morbidity and mortality rises with increasing burned surface area. It also rises with increasing age so that even small burns may be fatal in elderly people.\n\n\tWhole body surface area is taken as 100%. Proportion of surface burn is represented as percentage(%). There are many ways to estimate the body surface area burned.\n\n\n\t\tThe \u201cRule of 9\u2019s\u201d is commonly used to estimate the total body surface area (TBSA) burned in adults. In this, body is divided into 11 equal parts making this 99% and 1% is given to perineum. Therefore 9% each for the head and each upper limb; 18% each for each lower limb, front of trunk and back of trunk*.\n\n\t\tIn newborns and children (younger than 10 years), because of the larger size of head and small body surface area of limbs, the Rule of Nine is not applicable. Lund and Browder chart can be used for the calculation of total body surface area of burns in children*.\n\n\t\tThe \u201cRule of Palm\u201d is one closed hand of an individual is equal to his 1% body surface area.

The first aid has to be provided by the bystanders, who become the \u201cfirst responders\u201d. Extent of damage can be minimized by providing quick and proper on the site management.\n\nOn site management (first aid: Cool, Cover, Call):\u00a0The basic principles of first aid remain the same for all categories of burns with some specific management for particular category. Rescuer should take care of his/ her own safety before helping burn victim.\n\nThermal burns-\n\n\n\t\tThe victim should be removed from the burning premises.\n\n\t\tThe victim should be asked to lie down on the floor with burning side upper most (stop drop and roll)(tough rolling is not advised by some experts as this practice can transfer the fire to previously undamaged areas and can also cause other injuries) . Lying flat prevents the flames from involving the face, head and scalp hairs and also prevents the fire from going around the body (as flames go upwards).\n\n\t\tPrevent the victim from running as it only fans the flames.\n\n\t\tIf the victim is unable to walk or unconscious, drag him from burning site.\n\n\t\tIf there is lot of smoke along with fire, the rescuer should stay low/ crawl on the floor to minimize the inhalation of the toxic fumes (as the smoke, gases and hot air tend to rise). \u00a0Breathing should be done through the wet handkerchief to filter out the fumes, carbon and other toxic particles.\n\n\t\tPour water in copious amounts over the victim to extinguish the flames and to reduce the temperature of the burn.\n\n\t\t\u00a0In the absence of water any other non-inflammable clear liquid such as milk, canned drink can be used. Or\n\n\t\tThe victim should be put on the ground with the burning side uppermost and then wrapped in a heavy cotton cloth (blanket/rug/dari/coat or any other heavy fabric).Once the fire extinguishes, the blanket should be immediately removed as it can retain the heat. (Nylon or other inflammable material should not be used for this purpose). \u00a0\n\n\t\tFire extinguishers can be used for putting out the fire.\n\n\t\tDon\u2019t throw/apply mud/sand over the victim\u2019s body to put out the fire.\n\n\t\tAll\u00a0the burnt clothes (including belts, socks and shoes) and the ornaments (necklace, wrist watch, bangles, bracelets, nose-rings, ear-rings, rings around the fingers and toes, anklets) should also be removed.\n\n\t\tDo not apply any ointments, creams, lotions, powders,\u00a0grease, ghee, gentian violet,\u00a0calamine lotion, toothpastes, butter, colouring and other sticky agents, over the burn wound.\n\n\t\tTo avoid contamination, the burnt parts should be wrapped in a clean, dry sheet/cloth. Upper and lower limb injuries could be wrapped in pillow cover/plastic bags. Wrapping of wounds also reduces pain due to the air currents and provides protection during transport.\n\n\t\tIf burn injuries occur in closed chamber, patients may develop carbon monoxide poisoning. In such cases cleaning of the throat and putting oxygen mask during transportation is required.\n\n\t\tLook for associated injuries (fractures or spinal injuries) and take care accordingly.\n\n\t\tDon\u2019t give anything to eat and drink as this may result in vomiting.\n\n\t\tFormal oral analgesics are usually not given in the first aid. Reassurance and consolation to the victim and the family are important components of early care.\n\n\t\tCo-morbid conditions/other pre-existing conditions (such as pregnant women, alcoholism, and drug addictions) should be inquired.\n\n\t\tSeek immediate medical help. First 6 hours following injury are critical; transport the patient with severe burns to a hospital as soon as possible.\n\n\nChemical burns: \n\n\n\t\tIn chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.\n\n\t\tS.A.F.E. approach is recommended. S \u2013 Shout for help, A \u2013 Assess the scene quickly, F \u2013 Free from danger of violence, E \u2013 Evaluate the casualty.\n\n\t\tThe victims should be rushed to the nearest medical care units at the earliest.\n\n\nElectrical burns:\n\n\n\t\tSwitch off the power supply and victim should be removed with a non-conducting material like a dry wooden stick/pole/wooden chair.\n\n\t\tNo such maneuver should be attempted while a person is connected to a high voltage source, as the current is likely to \u201carc\u201d to the rescuer as he approaches.\n\n\t\tLook for airway, breathing and circulation. If there is no response or respiration, the victim most likely has suffered cardiac arrest and CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be started immediately at the site.\n\n\t\tLook for associated injuries.\n\n\t\tCall for help immediately.\n\n\nLightning injury:\n\n\n\t\tThe victims of lightning injuries are managed in the same way as those of electrical injuries. These patients can withstand apnoea (cessation of breathing) for very long periods of time. Sometimes prolonged resuscitation with cardiac massage and ventilation is required.\n\n\nManagement-\n\n\ta. Initial management includes assessment and maintenance of following parameters with ABCDE approach:\n\n\nAirway assessment and management in case of inhalational burns (burns in closed space, deep dermal burns to face, neck, or trunk, singed nasal hair ,carbon particles in oropharynx). \u00a0\u00a0\n\nBreathing: beware of inhalation and rapid airway compromise. \u00a0\n\nCirculation: ensure fluid replacement by securing wide bore intravenous line through which Ringer lactate solution can be given rapidly. Oral fluids such as ORS (Oral rehydration solution) may be given after initial resuscitation.\n\nDisability: evaluation for neurological deficit or any gross disability. Compartment syndrome occurs when excessive pressure builds up inside an enclosed space in the body. The legs, arms, and abdomen are mostly affected by compartment syndrome. Treatments for compartment syndrome focus on reducing the dangerous pressure in the body compartment. Dressings, casts, or splints that are constricting the affected body part must be removed.\n\nExposure: (Percentage area of burn), the whole of a patient should be examined (including the back) to get an accurate estimate of the burn area and to check for any concomitant injuries.\n\n\n\tb. In all cases, tetanus prophylaxis should be administered.\n\n\tc. Wound care:\n\n\n\t\tAdherent necrotic (dead) tissue should be cleaned.\n\n\t\tAfter debridement, the burn should be cleansed with either 0.25% (2.5 g/litre) chlorhexidine solution or 0.1% (1 g/litre) cetrimide solution, or with mild water based antiseptic. (Do not use alcohol-based solutions).\n\n\t\tA thin layer of antibiotic cream (silver sulfadiazine) should be applied.\n\n\t\tThe burn area is dressed with petroleum gauze and dry gauze thick enough to prevent seepage to the outer layers.\n\n\n\td. Systemic antibiotics are given to treat and prevent wound infections.\n\n\te. Proper nutrition with adequate supply of energy and proteins should be given to patients.\n\n\tf. Specialized care may be provided during healing process in the form of skin grafts or surgical release of contractures due to scars.\n\nFirst aid:\n\nDo's-\u00a0\n\n\n\t\tStop the burning process by removing clothing, jewelry and irrigating the burns.\n\n\t\tIn electrical burns, put the main switch off as quickly as possible and use a wooden scale or rod wooden chair to push the victim away from electricity. (No such maneuver should be attempted while a person is connected to a high voltage source, as the current is likely to \u201carc\u201d to the rescuer as he approaches)\n\n\t\tExtinguish flames by pouring plain water; if water is not available by applying a blanket and removing the blanket as soon as the flames are put off.\n\n\t\tIn chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.\n\n\t\tUse cool running water to reduce the temperature of the burn.\n\n\t\tWrap the patient in a clean cloth or sheet and transport to the nearest appropriate facility for medical care.\n\n\t\tTake care of fractures and probable injuries during transportation.\n\n\t\tEnsure A-Airway, B-Breathing & C-Circulation before transportation to higher center.\n\n\nDon'ts-\n\n\n\t\tDo not start first aid before ensuring your own safety (switch off electrical current, wear gloves for chemicals etc.)\n\n\t\tDo not apply ice because it may further damage the injured tissues.\n\n\t\tAvoid prolonged cooling with water because it may cause hypothermia (low temperature).\n\n\t\tDo not apply paste, oil, haldi (turmeric) or raw cotton to the burn or any other material.\n\n\t\tDo not open blisters with needle or pin, until topical antimicrobials can be applied, such as by a health-care provider.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nclinicalestablishments.nic.in/WriteReadData/\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs365/\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

It is used in about half of the cases and can be either\u00a0from internal sources in the form of brachytherapy or external therapy.\n\nChemotherapy: Chemotherapy in addition to surgery has proven to be useful in a number of different cancer types including: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and some lung cancers.\n\nStem cell transplants for treating cancer: Sometimes very high doses of chemotherapy are used, often with radiation therapy, in order to destroy the cancer cells. This treatment also kills the stem cells in the bone marrow. Soon after treatment, stem cells are replanted to replace those that were destroyed. These stem cells are given into a vein, much like a blood transfusion. Over time they settle in the bone marrow and begin to grow and make healthy blood cells. This process is called engraftment.\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.cancer.org\nwww.cancerresearchuk.org", "complications":"", "Prevention":"PREVENTION\n\n\tIdentification of the problem is necessary to prevent it.\n\n\n\t\tIf it is due to stress, focus on reducing it through relaxation, meditation, counselling etc.\n\n\t\tIf it is due to a sleeping disorder; treatment of the sleeping disorder is a prerequisite.\n\n\t\tReduce consumption of foods and drinks containing\u00a0caffeine.\n\n\t\tAvoid chewing objects such as pen or pencils, pins etc.\n\n\t\tPlace your tongue between your teeth, if you notice yourself clenching or grinding during the day\n\n\t\tVisit the dentist for proper diagnosis and treatment of the condition.", "classification":"Cancers are classified based on the nature of cells that the tumor cells resemble and are therefore classified as :\n\n\nCarcinoma: Cancers that are derived from epithelial cells are known as carcinomas.

The factors responsible for causing cancer could be alcohol, tobacco, certain chemicals, toxins and hormonal disturbances etc.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nRegular checkups & today's medical technology can detect all cancers early: Although regular medical care can indeed increase the ability to detect cancer at an early stage, it can't guarantee it. Most cancers are detected early but some still remain undetected till date.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nA needle biopsy or biopsy can disturb cancer cells, causing them to travel to other parts of the body: For most types of cancer, there is no conclusive evidence that needle biopsy (a procedure used to diagnose many types of cancer) causes cancer cells to spread.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nEveryone who has cancer has to have treatment: An individual can decide about the treatment after consulting with the doctor and learning about the options. Some people with cancer might not have any signs or symptoms or some might be at a terminal stage where doctor might just prescribe pain relievers.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nCancer is always painful: Some cancers never cause pain and are completely painless. For people who do experience cancer pain, especially people with advanced cancer, doctors have become more aware of the need to control such pain and have learned better ways to manage it. Although all pain may not be eliminated, it may be controlled so that it has little impact on the daily routine of a cancer patient.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nMost breast lumps are cancerous: Most breast lumps are not cancerous, but should be checked by a doctor. Women should not shy away and should report any changes at all that they find, because catching breast cancer early is beneficial. Your doctor may recommend a mammogram, ultrasound, or biopsy to determine whether a lump is cancerous or not.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nBreast implants can raise cancer risk: Women with breast implants are are not a greater risk of getting breast cancer. Standard mammograms might not work well but additional X-rays are sometimes needed to fully examine the breast tissue.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nNegative mammography means not to worry about cancer: Mammography can often detect breast cancer before it can be felt or before it produces symptoms. Overall, mammograms will pick up 80-90% of cancers but there are still 10-20% of cancers that will not be detected.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nWe don't need to talk about cancer: Cancer can be a difficult topic to address, particularly when you don't know what to share and how the other person would react. Talking about cancer to partners, family members, friends and colleagues can help to alleviate these feelings and at the same time dealing with the disease openly can improve outcomes and you will feel relieved.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nThere is nothing that can be done for treatment of cancer: This is a myth which needs to be debunked, there is a lot that can be done if cancer is detected at an early stage, and with the right strategies, one-third of the most common cancers can be prevented.\u00a0\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nThere are no signs or symptoms of cancer: It is true that early signs and symptoms are not known for all cancers, but for many cancers, including breast, cervical, skin, oral and colorectal cancers, and some childhood cancers, the benefits of early detection are indisputable.

Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia.\n\nClassification of childhood exotropia:\n\n\tIt is broadly classified as:\n\n\n\t\tIntermittent exotropia\n\n\nConstant exotropia:\n\n\tConstant exotropia may be of following types:-\n\n\n\t\tCongenital exotropia\n\n\t\tDecompensated intermittent exotropia\n\n\t\tSensory deprivation exotropia\n\n\t\tConsecutive exotropia\n\n\n\tAccording to distance-near relationships, exodeviations may be further subdivided as (Duane classification):-\n\n\tConvergence insufficiency exotropia: Due to convergence insufficiency, exotropia is worse for near vision.\n\n\tDivergence excess: Due to divergence excess, exotropia is worse for distance vision.\n\n\tBasic exotropia: Exotropia is equal for both near and distance vision.\n\n\tIntermittent exotropia:\n\n\tIntermittent exotropia frequently begins around the age of two years. A child with intermittent exotropia does not develop diplopia (double vision) due to bitemporal suppression, unlike acquired manifest exotropia in adults. With progressive suppression, constant exotropia may develop. Development of amblyopia (functional suppression of retina) is very rare. Manifest exotropia may be precipitated by factors such as fatigue, light glare, ill-health or visual distraction.\n\n\tCongenital exotropia:\n\n\tCongenital exotropia is rare and present at birth and may be associated with neurological abnormalities like cerebral palsy, midline defects or craniofacial syndromes. Infantile exotropia manifests during the first year of life.\n\n\tDecompensated intermittent exotropia:\n\n\tManifest intermittent exotropia may increase with time and become constant exotropia.\n\n\tSensory deprivation exotropia:\n\n\tSensory deprivation exotropia is due to disruption of binocular reflexes by acquired conditions like opaque media due to a disease or cataract. It begins in children over five years of age or in adults.\n\n\tConsecutive exotropia:\n\n\tConsecutive exotropia may develop following surgical overcorrection of esotropia (inward deviation of eyes), especially in an eye which is amblyopic. Occasionally, a deeply amblyopic convergent eye may become divergent (acquire resting position of eye).\n\n\tSecondary exotropia results from a primary sensory deficit (sensory deprivation exotropia) or occurs as a result of treatment for esotropia (consecutive exotropia).\n\nReferences:\n\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1199004-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1199102-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.aao.org/Intermittent_Exotropia\n\nhttli://eyewiki.aao.org/Exotroliia\n\nhttli://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/liubmed/10532736\n\nhttli://www.aoa.org/documents/olitometrists/CliG-12.lidf\n\nbjo.bmj.com/content/67/8/546.full.lidf\n\n\t\tKanski, Jack J.

However, successive generations in a family tend to have exotropia earlier and of greater severity.", "diagnosis":"For diagnosis of childhood exotropia:-\n\n\tA complete eye examination is conducted including record of ocular motility.\n\n\tOcular deviation for gaze at near (33 centimeters), distance (6 meters) and far distance (beyond 6 meters) is recorded.\n\n\tAssessment of the control of deviation is noted which helps in monitoring progression of intermittent exotropia. This deviation may be noted by the parents or is detected on eye examination.\n\n\tThe degree of deviation may be different in primary (straight gaze) and lateral (side) gaze positions. This is important to record from surgical point of view, to avoid post operative diplopia in lateral gaze.\n\n\tIntermittent exotropia:\n\n\tPatients with intermittent exotropia rarely have any complaints due to well developed suppression mechanism. Patient may have symptoms like eyestrain, headache, blurring of vision or difficulty in prolonged reading. However, these symptoms are quickly controlled by development of sensory adaptation. Not all intermittent exotropias are progressive. The deviation may remain stable for many years. The patient should be followed over time to know whether exotropia is stable or deteriorating.\n\n\tCongenital Exotropia:\n\n\tIt is characterised by:\n\n\t-\u00a0Fairly large and constant angle of deviation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Since infant uses left eye in left gaze and right eye in right gaze (uncrossed homonymous fixation), development of amblyopia is uncommon.

Deviations usually occur first for distance and later appear for near fixation. However, there are exceptions. The deviation remains constant or rarely may decrease.\n\n\tSensory deprivation exotropia:\n\n\tAn eye with poor vision (may be due to opaque media), or a blind eye drifts outwards into exodeviation. This usually occurs in children 2 to 4 years of age and in adults.\n\n\tConsecutive exotropia:\n\n\tDevelopment of consecutive exotropia, after correction of esotropia, may take many years. Usual factors for surgical overcorrection of esotropia are excessive amount of surgery, amblyopia, high hypermetropia, and poor preoperative evaluation of patient.\n\n\tExotropia should be distinguished from conditions like oculomotor nerve palsy or pseudoexotropia. In pseudoexotropia, visual axis of both eyes is straight, but the eyes appear divergent.", "management":"Nonsurgical methods of correction are adopted in children having good control of deviation as well as in those where risks of overcorrection are undesirable.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Correction of refractive errors: A trial of spectacle correction is given in all cases of refractive errors. Myopics, in particular, may control the deviation with glasses and may recover from intermittent exotropia.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Prescription of overcorrecting concave (minus) glasses: Overcorrecting concave lenses stimulate accommodative convergence and may improve quality of fusion. It may decrease the exotropia.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Part time occlusion: Part time occlusion of non deviating normal eye may treat suppression and amblyopia in deviating eye and thereby may correct exotropia and revert it to exophoria. Alternate occlusion of eyes may be done in cases showing equal preference. Part time occlusion has been found useful in very young children.\n\n\t- \u00a0 Use of prisms: Base-in prisms enforce bifoveal stimulation and help in relieving eyestrain. Prisms may be used to improve fusional control.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Orthoptic treatment: Fusional convergence exercises may be employed in patients with symptoms of convergence insufficiency type of intermittent exotropia. Active anti-suppression and diplopia awareness techniques may be used in cases of suppression. Patient is encouraged to improve control on exotropia voluntarily.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Botulinum toxin chemodenervation: It may be difficult to achieve long term alignment in cases of secondary exotropias. Botulinum toxin injection in extraocular muscles may be used in patients with constant exotropia who are at risk of postoperative diplopia and also who have undergone multiple operations. Preoperatively, if after botulinum injection, a patient develops intractable diplopia, then he may be advised against surgical correction.\n\n\tIn sensory deprivation exotropia, management involves elimination or reversal of treatable causes like removal of cataract. Prisms and botulinum toxin denervation do not play a significant role in the management.\n\n\tSurgical management of exotropia:\n\n\tSurgical management may be indicated in patients with:\n\n\t-\u00a0 Poor control of intermittent exotropia: When manifest intermittent exotropia is present atleast half of the time during the day.\n\n\t-\u00a0Progressive deterioration of control of intermittent exotropia: Patients with increase in size of deviation, loss of control and a progressive inability to re-fuse images after manifest deviation may be considered for surgery.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Severe eyestrain.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Troublesome diplopia.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Surgery may also be indicated to restore binocularity and also for cosmetic reasons.

It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.\n\n\tThe disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.\n\n\tThe disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.\n\n\tIn India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012\u20132015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.\n\n\tCCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages\n\n\t\u00a0wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pdfs/vol21no10\n\nicmr.nic.in/ijmr/2013/December\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/", "symtoms":"Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).\n\n\tThere may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).\n\n\tOther clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums.\n\n\tThere is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.\n\n\tThe mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness.

These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.\n\n\tCCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.\n\nEnvironmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.\n\nMode of transmission-\n\nAnimal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.\n\nHuman to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.\n\n\tIncubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease.

Cigarette smoking is most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD. Apart from cigarettes, people from India smoke tobacco using bidis, hookahs and chillums among several other forms of smoking. Bidis are more harmful than cigarettes (although they contain only one fourth the amount of nicotine, they produce four to five times more tar than cigarettes, making one bidi as harmful as one cigarette), hookahs are more harmful than bidis and the chillum is the most harmful of the lot. Smoking during pregnancy may also pose a risk for the foetus, by affecting lung growth and development of the foetus.\n\n\tPassive exposure to cigarette smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke or ETS) may also contribute to respiratory symptoms and COPD.\n\n(b) Indoor air pollution:\u00a0 Biomass (wood, animal dung, crop residues) and coal are used as the main source of energy for cooking, heating, and other household needs by some communities. In these communities, indoor air pollution is responsible for a greater fraction of COPD risk than smoking or outdoor air pollution. The other common indoor air pollutant is the burning of mosquito coils at homes to get rid of mosquitoes. Burning one mosquito coil in the night emits as much particulate matter pollution, as that is equivalent to around 100 cigarettes.\n\n(c)\u00a0Outdoor air pollution:\u00a0Outdoor air pollution mainly from emission of pollutants from motor vehicles and industries is an important public health problem. High levels of urban air pollution are harmful to individuals with existing heart or lung disease.\n\n(d) Occupational\u00a0dusts and chemicals\u00a0(such as vapours, irritants, and fumes)\n\n(e)\u00a0Lung growth and Development-Any factor that affects lung growth during gestation and childhood has the potential for increasing an individual\u2019s risk of developing COPD.\n\n(f) Oxidative Stress\u00a0(excess of oxidants and/or depletion of antioxidants are termed oxidative stress): An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.\n\n(g)\u00a0Infections: Infections (viral and bacterial) may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. A history of severe childhood respiratory infection has been associated with reduced lung function and increased respiratory symptoms in adulthood. Tuberculosis is recognized as a risk factor for COPD.\n\n(h)Socioeconomic Status: There is evidence that the risk of developing COPD is inversely related to socioeconomic status. It is not clear, however, whether this pattern reflects exposures to indoor and outdoor air pollutants, crowding, poor nutrition, or other factors that are related to low socioeconomic status.\n\n(i)Nutrition:\u00a0The role of nutrition as an independent risk factor for the development of COPD is unclear. Malnutrition and weight loss can reduce respiratory muscle strength and endurance, apparently by reducing both respiratory muscle mass and the strength of the remaining muscle fibers.\n\n(j)Asthma: Asthma may be risk factor for the development of COPD, although the evidence is not conclusive.\n\n\tThe causes for COPD have opposite patterns according to the geographic areas. In high- and middle-income countries tobacco smoke is the biggest risk factor, meanwhile in low-income countries exposure to indoor air pollution, such as the use of biomass fuels for cooking and heating, is the main risk factor.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/respiratory/copd/causes/en/\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/f\n\nicmr.nic.in/ijmr/2013/february/0203.pdf\n\nwww.japi.org/february_2012_special\n\nwww.japi.org/february_2012_special", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has symptoms of a chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnoea (difficult or labored breathing) and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.\n\n\tCOPD is confirmed by a diagnostic test called \"spirometry\".

 {"id":61, "name":"Cavernous Haemangioma of Eyelid", "intro":"Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is defined as the presence of redundant non-oedematous conjunctiva that may be asymptomatic, or it may be symptomatic due to unstable tear film or mechanical disruption of tear flow. Conjunctivochalasis is usually found in older people and is often overlooked, and is classified as a normal variant of eye due to ageing. However, it has been seen in patients as early as first decade of life with an increase in prevalence and severity with age. It is usually bilateral condition and consists of an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva over the lower lid margin, most commonly in the infero-temporal region. However, in addition to temporal region, it may involve bulbar conjunctiva along nasal, central lid-margin or any combination of these areas. The presence of loose redundant tissue causes disruption of inferior tear meniscus. This conjunctival prolapse may impede tear outflow through the inferior punctum, resulting in epiphora (watering from eyes). \u00a0It may also involve upper bulbar area with loose conjunctiva, but it is less common.\n\n\tDescriptions of conjunctivochalasis were noted as early as 1908 by Elschnig. \u00a0Braunschweig in 1921 and Wollenberg (1922) also described this condition. The term conjunctivochalasis was coined by W L Hughes in 1942. (Hughes WL. Conjunctivochalasis. Am J Ophthalmol 1942; 25: 48-51).They described more severe findings of CCh such as pain, subconjuntival haemorrhage and exposure keratopathy. Later works described mild/ moderate symptoms of CCh like dry eye and excessive lacrimation.\n\n\tOther conditions causing tearing and ocular irritation must be ruled out as causative or contributory agents. Similar symptoms may be present in:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Isolated dry eye syndrome.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Dry eye syndrome with CCh.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Lid diseases e.g. blepharitis.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Allergic eye disease.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Autoimmune thyroid eye disease.\u00a0\n\n\t\t\u00a0Contact lens wearers.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://eyewiki.aao.org/Conjunctivochalasis\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155901 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttp://bjo.bmj.com/content/88/3/388.full\n\nhttp://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/cases/162-conjunctivochalasis.htm\n\nhttp://www.ophthalmologymanagement.com/articleviewer.aspx?articleID=108876\n\nYanoff Myron, Sassani Joseph W.

Senile changes involving the subcutaneous, elastic or supporting tissue in the conjunctiva was suggested as the cause. Eye rubbing, mechanical irritation or trauma to conjunctiva, and abnormal eyelid position were all implicated.\n\nFrancis et al. based on clinical and histopathological study suggested that the development of CCh is multi-factorial, which includes local trauma, ultra-violet radiation and delayed tear clearance as inciting factors (Francis IC, Chan DG, Kim P, et al. Case- controlled clinical and histopathological study of conjunctivochalasis. Br J Ophthalmol 2005; 89:302-305).\n\nWatanabe et al. showed microscopic lymphangiectasia of the subconjunctiva without any inflammation. There was loss of typical fiber patterns with fragmented elastic fibers and sparse collagen fibers. They suggested that mechanical forces between the lower eyelid and conjunctiva gradually impaired lymphatic flow, resulting in lymphatic dilatation and clinical CCh (Watanabe A, Yokoi N, Kinoshita S, et al. Clinicopathologic study of conjunctivochalasis. Cornea 2004; 23:294-298).\n\nYokoi et al. by immunestaining, compared conjunctival samples of CCh patients with those of known normal and known inflammatory ocular surface disease and showed negligible role of inflammation in CCh (Yokoi N, Komuro A, Nishii M, et al. Clinical impact of conjunctivochalasis on the ocular surface. Cornea [Clinical Trial] 2005; 24(Suppl.8):S24-31).\n\n\tMore recent studies have suggested a mechanistic approach to the development of CCh. Mechanistic evidence suggests a shift in the normal balance of conjunctival matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are enzymes that modify or degrade extracellular matrix, possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of CCh. MMP-1 and MMP-3 enzymes have been noted to be over-expressed in conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts in tissue culture, while enzyme levels of TIMPs are unchanged (Li DQ, Meller D, Liu Y, Tseng SC. Over-expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by cultured conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2000; 41: 404- 410). This interaction or change in balance of MMPs and their inhibitors, which normally participate in connective tissue degradation and remodelling, leads to clinically evident redundant conjunctiva observed in conjunctivochalasis.", "diagnosis":"CCh is one of the most common under diagnosed and misdiagnosed ocular surface disease. Non-specific symptoms along with intermittent findings of conjunctival oedema often lead to misdiagnosis. Due to fluctuation in findings of disease process, several clinical exams may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis of CCh is mainly clinical.\n\n\tSlit lamp biomicroscopy (by an eye specialist) shows prolapsed or folds of conjunctiva in temporal, nasal or central part of lower lid-margin. Presence of redundant conjunctiva over lower lid margin suggests CCh. Prolapsed conjunctiva causes a disruption of tear movement and outflow through inferior lacrimal punctum resulting in epiphora.\n\nSigns on slit lamp examination are:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Presence of redundant conjunctiva.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Altered tear meniscus.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Dryness of eyes on Schirmer test.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Reduced tear film break up time (BUT).\n\n\t\t\u00a0Fluorescein sodium/ rose bengal dye stain shows conjunctival staining in non-exposure zone.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Inferior punctum blockage in nasal CCh, resulting in epiphora, in spite of normal and patent lacrimal passage.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Anterior migration of muco-cutaneous junction caused by overspill of aqueous tears due to obliteration of tear meniscus.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Regional lid-margin inflammation, again due to overspill of aqueous tears.\n\n\n\tPrior to correct diagnosis, patients with CCh are often diagnosed with more common ocular surface diseases, such as\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Dry eye\n\n\t\t\u00a0Anterior blepharitis\n\n\t\t\u00a0Meibomian gland disease or\n\n\t\t\u00a0Allergic eye conditions.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tOften CCh is not considered a significant clinical entity, or significance of the conjunctival finding is not recognised.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tMany patients are first diagnosed when epiphora develops due to blocked puncta caused by redundant conjunctiva.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGrading systems:\n\nH\u00f6h et al., looked at the number of lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF) (H\u00f6h H, Schirra F, Kienecker C, et al. Lid-parallel conjunctival folds are a sure diagnostic sign of dry eye. Ophthalmologe 1995; 92: 802-808). They noted the number of LIPCOF had a high predictive value for diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\n\n\tAt present, the most widely used grading system was proposed by Meller and Tseng in 1998 who adapted the scale by H\u00f6h and associates, and included the extent of CCh, changes with down-gaze and digital pressure, and presence of punctal occlusion (Meller D, Tseng SCG. Conjunctivochalasis: literature review and possible pathophysiology. Surv Ophthalmol 1998; 43: 225-232).\n\n\tAccordingly, the grades of severity of conjunctivochalasis, based on the number of folds and their relationship to the tear meniscus height are:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Grade 1: No persistent fold.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Grade 2: Single, small fold.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Grade 3: More than two folds and not higher than the tear meniscus.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Grade 4: Multiple folds and higher than the tear meniscus.\n\n\n\tThe newest grading system proposed by Zhang et al. in 2011 further modified Meller and Tseng\u2019s approach by including three symptoms (epiphora, feeling of dryness, and foreign body sensation) and unstable tear film break-up time (BUT) (Zhang X, Li Q, Zou H, et al. Assessing the severity of conjunctivochalasis in a senile population: a community-based epidemiology study in Shanghai, china. BMC Pub Health 2011; 11:198). These modifications rule out asymptomatic, normal older people from the noted very high prevalence rates of CCh. The validity of this requires further studies.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology:\n\n\tMost common histopathologic findings are elastosis or chronic non-granulomatous inflammation (Yanoff Myron, Sassani Joseph W. Ocular Pathology. Seventh Edition. Elsevier Saunders. 2015. P. 216.).\n\n\tMicroscopic lymphangiectasia is typically present.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nConjunctivochalasis should be differentiated from:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Dry eye syndrome: \n\n\n\tIn dry eye, symptoms are worse in the evening, aggravates in up-gaze, Fluorescein sodium/ rose bengal dye stains inter-palpebral exposure zone, increased blinking and punctal occlusion improves it.\n\n\tIn conjunctivochalasis, symptoms are same throughout the day, aggravates in down-gaze, Fluorescein sodium/rose bengal dye stains non-exposure zone, increased blinking and punctal occlusion worsens it, unlike dry eye disease.\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Sj\u00f6gren syndrome.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Meibomian gland dysfunction.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Conjunctival infection.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Conjunctival inflammation.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Chemosis of conjunctiva.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Entropion.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tAsymptomatic conjunctivochalasis requires no treatment.\n\n\tTreat associated ocular diseases such as:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Dry eye\n\n\t\t\u00a0Anterior blepharitis\n\n\t\t\u00a0Meibomian gland disease or\n\n\t\t\u00a0Allergic eye conditions.\n\n\n\tTherapeutic modalities for symptomatic patients:\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Topical artificial tears lubrication: Topical artificial tears help in lubrication and may provide temporary relief.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Topical steroids: Similar to artificial tears, topical corticosteroids also provide some relief and may be used for mild presentations.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Antihistamines: Antihistamines are useful if there is a component of allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tSurgical therapy is indicated when conservative medical therapy fails and other associated ocular disease has been ruled out.\n\n\tSurgical methods are directed against the redundant conjunctival folds.\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Conjunctival excision: Conjunctival excision of the redundant tissue is the most commonly employed procedure for CCh. Conjunctival resection is customised according to degree of conjunctival laxity. Sutures or fibrin glue is utilised for apposition. Complete involvement of bulbar conjunctiva may require 360 degrees of resection.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Conjunctival fixation to sclera: Conjunctival fixation to sclera may be done after excision of redundant conjunctiva.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Amniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation has been described as a treatment with either suture fixation of the amniotic membrane or fixation through the use of fibrin glue. Since CCh is a condition of redundant conjunctiva, many feels that addition of tissue, such as amniotic membrane is not warranted.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Superficial thermocautery: Minimally invasive superficial thermocautery of the inferior conjunctiva, helps in CCh by improving conjunctival laxity. Cautery applied over redundant conjunctiva causes contraction of it to restore tear outflow.\n\n\n\tExtensive conjunctival resections should be avoided in order to minimise complications, such as contraction of fornices, cicatricial entropion, and restriction of extra-ocular movement.\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPrognosis is generally good when the correct treatment is adopted according to the symptom complex in each individual patient.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"COVID-19 can be prevented by following COVID appropriate behaviour and getting vaccine.\n\nFollow COVID appropriate behavior:\n\n\tWhen COVID-19 is spreading in the community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue.\n\nTo make your environment safe avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are Closed, Crowded, or involve Close contact. Prefer to meet people outside asoutdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones.\n\n\tIf you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, stay home and isolate, and consult your health care provider. If you need to go out, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others.\n\n\tIf you have fever, cough and difficult breathing, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccines:\n\n\tAs of January 2021, Over 170 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are being developed by different agencies globally. Of these at least 60 candidate vaccines are in different phases of human trials and several vaccines are approved for the human use. Globally, various scientific techniques are being used for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine such as:\n\nVirus vaccines: These vaccines use the virus itself in a weakened or inactivated form. There are two types of virus vaccines against coronavirus, weakened virus and inactivated virus vaccines.\n\nViral-vector vaccines: In the development of these vaccines, a virus (such as adenovirus or measles) is used as vector or carrier and is genetically engineered to produce coronavirus proteins in the body, triggering protective immunity against it. The two types of viral-vector vaccines under development are replicating viral vector (can replicate within cells) and non-replicating viral vector (cannot replicate within cells).\n\nNucleic-acid vaccines: Nucleic acid vaccines use genetic material from a disease-causing virus or bacterium (a pathogen) to stimulate\u00a0protective immunity\u00a0against it. The genetic material could be DNA or RNA.\n\nProtein subunit vaccines: Protein subunit vaccines use fragments of protein from the disease-causing virus to trigger protective immunity against it. The two types of protein-based vaccines being developed against the coronavirus are the protein subunit vaccines and virus-like particle vaccines.\n\n\tIn India, two types of vaccines Covishield and Covaxine have been rolled out for vaccination in a phased manner. Covishield is based on viral vector technology and Covaxine is a whole virion inactivated corona virus vaccine. Two doses of vaccine are given at four weeks apart.\n\nEveryday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses should be followed, these include:\n\n\n\t\tWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.\n\n\t\tAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\n\t\tAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\n\t\tCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\n\t\tClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n\t\tMaintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.\n\n\t\tWear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\u00a0\n\n\t\tStay home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover.\n\n\t\tIf you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.\n\n\nAs a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets-\n\n\n\t\tEnsure regular hand washing with soap and potable water after touching animals and animal products\n\n\t\tAvoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands;\n\n\t\tAvoid contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products.\n\n\t\tStrictly avoid any contact with other animals in the market (e.g., stray cats and dogs, rodents, birds, bats).\n\n\t\tAvoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or fluids on the soil or structures of shops and market facilities.\n\n\t\tAvoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products: Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices\n\n\nContacts should be monitored for 14 days from the last unprotected contact.\n\n\n\t\tA contact is a person involved in any of the following:\n\n\t\tProviding direct care for 2019-nCoV patients, working with health care workers infected with novel coronavirus, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a 2019-nCoV patient.\n\n\t\tWorking together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment a with 2019-nCoV patient\n\n\t\tTraveling together with 2019-nCoV patient in any kind of conveyance\n\n\t\tLiving in the same household as a 2019-nCoV patient within a 14\u2010day period after the onset of symptoms in the case under consideration\n\n\nKey advice for older adults and people with pre-existing conditions:\n\n\n\t\tWhen you have visitors to your home, exchange \u201c1 metre greetings\u201d, like a wave, nod, or bow.\n\n\t\tAsk visitors and those you live with to wash their hands.\n\n\t\tRegularly clean and disinfect surfaces in your home, especially areas that people touch a lot.\n\n\t\tIf someone you live with isn\u2019t feeling well (especially with possible COVID-19 symptoms), limit your shared spaces.\n\n\t\tIf you become ill with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider by telephone before visiting your healthcare facility.\n\n\t\tMake a plan in preparation for an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community.\n\n\t\tWhen you go out in public, follow the same preventative guidelines as you would at home.\n\n\t\tStay up to date using information from reliable sources.\n\n\nWith a combination of public health measures disease spread can be prevented and controlled,such as\n\n\n\t\tRapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases,\n\n\t\tLimit human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, by\n\n\t\tidentification and follow up of the contacts\n\n\t\tinfection prevention and control in healthcare settings\n\n\t\tImplementation of health measures for travellers,\n\n\t\tAwareness- raising in the population and risk communication\n\n\t\tPreventing transmission amplification events\n\n\nReferences-\n\nhttps://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVID19VaccineOG111Chapter16.pdf\n\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\n\nhttps://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-infection-with-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\n\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":62, "name":"Corneal Abrasion", "intro":"Conjunctival concretions (Conjunctival lithiasis) are small vascular, granular, yellowish-white deposits being produced due to conjunctival degeneration and are found in the sub-epithelium of palpebral conjunctiva and fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) in the elderly group or in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposits were found in patients as young as 20 years old, with the range of occurrence from 30-80 years old. Concretions appear as multiple tiny inclusion cysts containing yellowish-white deposits of inspissated mucous and degenerated epithelial debris including keratin. They are frequently discrete, but confluent concretions are not uncommon. In one study, no significant difference was found between the lacalisation on the upper and lower eyelids, right or left eye, and most of the concretions were superficial and hard, and mainly single. Associated dysfunction of meibomian glands was also noticed in some patients.\n\n\tA recent article has emphasised how patients with conjunctival concretions are potentially affected with dry eye disease.\n\n\tThey are usually idiopathic, but they have also been associated with:\n\n\n\t\tChronic atopic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t\tFollowing post-trachomatous degeneration.\n\n\t\tSulphadiazine eye drop administration.\n\n\n\tDegenerations of the conjunctiva are common conditions that, in most cases, have relatively little effect on ocular function and vision. These conditions increase in prevalence with increasing age as a result of past inflammation, of long-term toxic effects of environmental exposure causing deposition, or of ageing itself. Conjunctival degenerations may be associated with chronic irritation, dryness, or previous history of trauma.\n\n\tIdentification of corneal and conjunctival degenerations has improved with the use of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemical staining, and genetic testing.\n\nReferences:\n\nBasak Samar K.

 {"id":63, "name":"Chalcosis", "intro":"Congenital anomalies (birth defects) can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (e.g. metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations. Congenital anomalies are the major cause of new born deaths within four weeks of birth and can result in long-term disability with a significant impact on individuals, families, societies and health-care systems.\n\n\tIn nearly 50% of cases the exact cause of congenital anomaly could not be identified, although there are some known risk factors which can be linked with the causation of malformation. Congenital anomalies can be caused by single gene defects, chromosomal disorders, multifactorial inheritance, environmental teratogens (an agent, which can cause a birth defect) and micronutrient deficiencies.\n\n\tAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, an estimated 270 000 deaths during the first 28 days of life were reported due to congenital anomalies globally.\n\n\tAccording to March of Dimes (MOD) global report on birth defects 7.9 million births (6% of total births) occur annually worldwide with serious birth defects and 94% of these births occur in the middle and low income countries. According to joint WHO and MOD meeting report, birth defects account for 7% of all neonatal mortality and 3.3 million under five deaths. \u00a0\n\n\tThe prevalence of birth defects in India is 6-7% which translates to around 1.7 million birth defects annually. The common birth defects include congenital heart disease (8-10 per 1000 live births), congenital deafness (5.6-10 per 1000 live births), and neural tube defects (4-11.4 per 1000 live births) (March of Dimes report, 2006).\u00a0\n\n\tSome birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood.\n\n\tThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has addressed the problem with the implementation of various national health programmes.

However, known causes can be divided broadly into two groups:\n\n\nPreconception causes are genetic and partially genetic, originating mostly before conception. Birth defects are due to abnormalities of the genetic material--chromosomes and genes including chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects and multifactorial disorders (which are caused by the interaction of genes and the environment).\n\nPost-conception causes develop after conception, but before birth. Birth defect is caused by an intra-uterine environmental factor. This includes teratogens that interfere with normal growth and development of the embryo or foetus, mechanical forces that deform the foetus, and vascular accidents that disrupt the normal growth of organs.\n\n\nRisk factors-\n\nSocioeconomic and demographic factors:\n\n\n\t\tCongenital anomalies are more frequently seen among low income families and countries.\n\n\t\tAbout 94% of severe congenital anomalies occur in low- and middle-income countries due to poor access to sufficient and healthy food, increased exposure to various infections and alcohol (cause foetal alcohol syndrome) and insufficient health care delivery system.\n\n\t\tMaternal age: advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.\n\n\n\tGenetic factors:\n\n\tConsanguinity (when parents are related by blood) increases the prevalence of rare genetic congenital anomalies; it nearly doubles the risk for anomalies in first-cousin unions. Consanguinity rates in India vary from 1% to 4% in the northern region to 20-30% in the southern region (especially uncle niece marriage). Consanguineous marriage in Indian Muslim communities is 20-30%.

When cancer develops in the cervix of female it is termed as cervical cancer or cancer cervix. Cervix is the lower part of the uterus and connects the body of the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).The lower part of the cervix (ectocervix) lies within the vagina and the upper two thirds of the cervix (endocervix) lies above the vagina. Most cervical cancers originate in the area where the endocervix and ectocervix join.\n\n\tCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\tThe highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.\n\n\tIndia has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age.\n\n\tNearly all cases of cervical cancer can be attributable to Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a group of viruses and one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions. HPV types (16 and 18) cause 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions worldwide.\n\n\tBased on Indian studies about 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18 (Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)*.\n\n\tOther epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.\n\n\tIndia also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.\n\n\tCervical cancer can be prevented by vaccinating all young females against the HPVs and by screening and treating precancerous lesions in women.

In a conventional Pap test, the specimen (or smear) is placed on a glass microscope slide and a fixative is added. In an automated liquid-based Pap cytology test, cervical cells collected with a brush or other instrument are placed in a vial of liquid preservative. One advantage of liquid-based testing is that the same cell sample can also be tested for the presence of high-risk types of HPV, a process known as \u201cPap and HPV co-testing.\n\nVisual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) - Doctor may apply a dilute acetic acid solution (vinegar solution) to the cervix, which causes abnormal areas to turn white. Further a biopsy can be taken from abnormal area.\n\nHPV testing for high-risk HPV type- HPV testing is used to look for the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells.\n\n\n\n\t\tScreening is recommended for every woman from aged 30 to 49 years at least once in a lifetime and ideally more frequently (WHO). Women living with HIV are advised to follow a different screening schedule.\n\n\t\tWomen who test negative with VIA or cytology, re-screening is advised at an interval of three to five years; whereas women who test negative with HPV testing, re-screening should be done after a minimum interval of five years.\n\n\t\tIf cancer is suspected in women during screening, they should be referred to a facility for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.\n\n\t\tWomen who screen positive for cervical pre-cancer can be treated with Cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and should receive post-treatment follow-up after 12 months.\n\n\nDiagnostic tests for detection of cervical pre-cancer: some times, a diagnostic test is used for definitive diagnosis or confirmation of pre-cancer or cancer subsequent to positive screening results. Colposcopy, biopsy and endocervical curettage (ECC) are the commonly used diagnostic tests for cervical pre-cancer.\n\n\nColposcopy is the examination of the cervix, vagina and vulva with an instrument called colposcope. It is used in patients with positive screening results.\n\nBiopsy is the removal of small sample of abnormal tissue for microscopic examination. Biopsies can be taken from areas of the cervix that are VIA-positive or from areas that appear suspicious for cancer.\n\nEndocervical curettage (ECC) is a simple procedure in which some surface cells are gently scraped from the endocervical canal with a special thin instrument or spatula and examined under microscope. An endocervical cytobrush specimen may also be used for examination.\n\n\nCervical cancer stages-\n\n\nStage 0: The cancer is found only in the first layer of cells lining the cervix, not in the deeper tissues. The tumor is called carcinoma in situ and not considered to be an invasive cancer.\n\nStage I:\u00a0The cancer has spread from the cervix lining into the deeper tissue but is still just found in the uterus. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\n\nStage II:\u00a0The cancer has spread beyond the cervix to nearby areas, such as the vagina or tissue near the cervix, but it is still inside the pelvic area. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\n\nStage III:\u00a0The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and vagina but not to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\n\nStage IV:\u00a0 The disease has spread to nearby organs or other parts of the body.\n\n\n\tWHO has recommended new guideline for screening and treatment to prevent cervical cancer in July 2021.

Two HPV vaccines are there - a bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine.The quadrivalent vaccine gives 100% protection against infection from HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for around 70% of all cervical cancers. It also protects against HPV types 6 and 11 that cause genital warts.\n\n\tThe vaccination schedule depends on the age of the vaccine recipient. WHO (March, 2016)a recommended schedule for both HPV vaccines is as-\n\n\n\t\tFemales <15 years at the time of first dose: a 2-dose schedule (0, 6 months) is recommended. (If the interval between doses is shorter than 5 months, then a third dose should be given at least 6 months after the first dose.)\n\n\t\tFemales \u226515 years at the time of first dose: a 3-dose schedule (0, 1-2, 6 months) is recommended.\n\n\t\t3-dose schedule is recommended for those known to be immunocompromised and/or HIV-infected.\n\n\n\t(The vaccines cannot treat HPV infection or HPV-associated disease such as cancer, but it prevents the infection).\n\n\tSome countries are vaccinating boys for prevention of genital cancers and genital warts in males.\n\n\tTwo vaccines (bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine), which are licensed in more than a 120 countries, are available in India with the approval of Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). 63 countries have also included HPV vaccination to girls in their national immunization programmes. HPV vaccination for girls is recommended by Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) and Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India\u00a0(FOGSI) and Cancer foundation of India b.\n\n\tOther preventive interventions may be recommended to boys and girls as appropriate are:\n\n\n\t\teducation about safe sexual practices, including delayed start of sexual activity\n\n\t\tpromotion and provision of condoms for those already engaged in sexual activity\n\n\t\twarnings about tobacco use, which often starts during adolescence, and which is an important risk factor for cervical and other cancers, and\n\n\t\tmale circumcision.\n\n\n\tMale circumcision and the use of condoms have shown a significant protective effect against HPV transmission.\n\nSecondary prevention: screening for and treating pre-cancer\n\n\tEarly detection, by screening all women in the target age group (30-49 years) followed by treatment of detected precancerous lesions can prevent the majority of cervical cancers. Cervical cancer screening should be an essential part of a woman\u2019s routine health care. It detects pre-cancer and cancer among women who have no symptoms and may feel perfectly healthy. Important aspect of screening is that both precancerous lesions and early cervical cancers can be treated very successfully at this stage.\n\nTertiary prevention: treatment of invasive cervical cancer\n\n\tThe goal of tertiary prevention is to decrease the number of deaths due to cervical cancer. Women suspected of having invasive cervical cancer should be referred to facilities that offer cancer diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate treatment in early stage of cancer can result in cure. In advanced stage of cancer treatment and palliative care can improve quality of life, control symptoms and minimize pain suffering.\n\nFive key messages (WHO)c :\n\n\n\t\tCervical cancer is a disease that can be prevented.\n\n\t\tThere are tests to detect early changes in the cervix (known as pre-cancers) that may lead to cancer if not treated.\n\n\t\tThere are safe and effective treatments for these early changes.\n\n\t\tAll women aged 30\u201349 years should be screened for cervical cancer at least once.\n\n\t\tThere is a vaccine for girls that can help prevent cervical cancer.\n\n\n\tNew strategies for screening and treatment of cervical pre-cancer lesions for cervical cancer prevention by WHO:\n\n\tThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the new guidelines for screening and treatment to prevent cervical cancer in July 2021.

It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.\n\n\tThe disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.\n\n\tThe disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.\n\n\tIn India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012\u20132015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.\n\n\tCCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages\n\n\t\u00a0wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pdfs/vol21no10\n\nicmr.nic.in/ijmr/2013/December\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/", "symtoms":"Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).\n\n\tThere may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).\n\n\tOther clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums.\n\n\tThere is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.\n\n\tThe mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness.

These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.\n\n\tCCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.\n\nEnvironmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.\n\nMode of transmission-\n\nAnimal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.\n\nHuman to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.\n\n\tIncubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.\n\n\tThe incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.\n\n\tCCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings.

 {"id":67, "name":"Diarrhea", "intro":"Chemical Injuries to the Eye constitutes an ophthalmic emergency, due to the potential for permanent visual impairment and threat to the structural integrity of the eye. Severe injury may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium.\n\n\tChemical injuries cause tissue destruction created from a wave of strongly dissociated ions flooding the eyelid and/or tear film and reservoir, penetrating the cornea and adjacent tissues, thereby reaching to the aqueous humour. Immediate shrinkage of the collagenous envelope of the eye results in a rapid rise in intraocular pressure, followed by a second rise which lasts longer and is produced by prostaglandin release. At any time, rise in pressure can occur due to clogging of the trabecular meshwork by necrotic debris, and from organisation of inflammatory components, followed by cicatricial closure of the chamber angle, especially inferiorly.\n\n\tInflammatory cells, most importantly, neutrophils, pour into the damaged tissue, releasing superoxide radicals and tissue degrading enzymes. There may be development of corneal ulcerations, perforations, and vascularisation.\n\n\tResponsible chemicals producing injury are numerous and include cleaning agents, fertilisers, refrigerants, cement, preservatives and fireworks. Alkali injuries occur more frequently than acid injuries, due to alkalis being more commonly present in household and industrial products. Ocular burns caused by detergents and thermal agents are less common.\n\n\tFortunately, the majority of chemical injuries are classified as mild. Injured patients are usually young, male and exposure most commonly occurs in a variety of agricultural, industrial and domestic settings, or less commonly in association with a criminal assault. Unfortunately, there is a rise in number of patients presenting with chemical eye injuries resulting from assault.\n\n\tThe final visual prognosis is influenced by the nature of the chemical insult, the extent of ocular damage, and the timing and efficacy of treatment.\n\n\tRegarding terminology, the literature is full with expressions like alkali \u2018burns\u2019, potentially confusing the alkali-injury terminology with a, usually non-existent, thermal, or even open flame component. When both chemical and thermal injuries occur simultaneously, the terms \u2018alkali-thermal injury\u2019 or \u2018thermal-alkali injury\u2019 might be used, with the most prominent injurious agent stated first. Acid injuries should be referred to in a similar way.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.dos-times.org/pulsar9088/20140622164942531.pdf\n\nhttp://bjo.bmj.com/content/85/11/1379.full\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v19/n3/full/6701490a.html\n\nHolland Edward J, Mannis Mark J, Lee W Barry.

Acids and bases are the most frequently implicated chemical agents. The severity of the injury is related to the nature, concentration, quantity and pH of the chemical involved. It also depends upon the duration of contact and surface area of exposure. History of high-velocity (explosive) chemical injury should always raise suspicion of an associated intraocular foreign body.\n\nCausative agents of chemical injury are:\n\nAlkalis:\n\n\tMost common causes of alkali injury to the eye are lye, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lime, wet/dry cement and ammonia. Most severe injuries are typically caused by ammonia and lye which are both capable of rapid penetration into the eye. The severity of the injury is dependent on the anion concentration, the dissociation of the alkali, and the quantity of fluid. A wave of hydroxyl ions rapidly advances through ocular tissues, causing massive cell death by saponification of cellular membranes and extensive hydrolysis of glycosa-aminoglycans and collagen within the corneal matrix. Damage caused by lime injuries is reduced by the precipitation of calcium soaps that hinders further penetration. Presence of magnesium hydroxide in fireworks results in a combined chemical and thermal injury.\n\nThe most important agents causing alkali injuries to the eye are:\n\n\nAmmonia (NH3): Ammonia (NH3) is available as a fertiliser and refrigerant, and is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Ammonium hydroxide ranks high in severity in causing injuries to eyes. It is commonly used as a household cleansing agent. Even 7% solution of ammonia is capable of causing major ocular damage, due to its high solubility and penetrability.\n\nLye: Lye, caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), penetrates into the interior of the eye in 3-5 minutes. Solid sodium hydroxide, often used as a drain cleaner, can cause pressure to develop within the drainpipe, resulting in an explosion of lye into the face and eyes. Warmed lye is also commonly used to straighten curly hair. Caustic soda is also used in the manufacture of pulp, paper, textiles and soaps. Due to easy availability in home, it is a common chemical being used by paramours during attack. Lye injuries rank second in severity to those produced by ammonium hydroxide.\n\nPotassium hydroxide (KOH): Potassium hydroxide (KOH) or caustic potash penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide. Dissolution of potassium hydroxide in water is strongly exothermic (produces heat) and it is corrosive.\n\nMagnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2): Magnesium hydroxide(Mg(OH)2) also penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares; the combination of thermal injury and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury than that being produced by either type alone.\n\nLime (Ca(OH)2): Lime, fresh lime or quicklime, calcium hydrate, plaster, cement , mortar and whitewash penetrates the eye less rapidly because it reacts with epithelial cell membranes, forming calcium soaps that precipitate and hinder further penetration. Lime, found in cement and plaster, is the most common cause of alkali injury. Retained particulate matter provides sump for on-going injury. Despite this, these injuries can be quite severe, with the corneal opacity visible before the opacity in case of ammonium or sodium hydroxide.\n\nMethyl ethyl ketone peroxide: Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is a catalyst, and commonly used in various industries. It can cause both immediate and delayed corneal injury. There may be exacerbations and remissions of limbal and corneal disease lasting for more than twenty years.\n\n\nAcids:\n\n\tWeak acidic compounds precipitate proteins within the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, thus acting as a partial barrier to further penetration of the chemical. It leaves a greyish white epithelium, which often obscures all tissue underneath it. Stripping off this opacified epithelium often reveals a relatively clear underlying corneal stroma. As long as the corneal stem cells near the limbus are not damaged, epithelial recovery is likely, with little or no stromal cloudiness.\n\n\tHydrofluoric, sulphuric, sulphurous, chromic, and hydrochloric acids are the most common causes of acid burns. Strong acids ionise completely in an aqueous solution. The strength of an acid depends on its ability to dissociate and lose a proton. The primary mechanism of damage by acids is due to the action of dissociated proton. Hydrofluoric acid causes most severe acid injury due to its unique properties. Hydrofluoric acid has a unique dissolving action which allows it to quickly penetrate into deeper tissues. Moreover, hydrofluoric acid chelates all calcium and magnesium from cells, thereby halting cellular biochemical activity.\n\n\tAlthough alkalis typically cause the most serious chemical injuries, the presence of an acid injury does not preclude an equally severe ocular injury. Very strong acids, however, overcome this precipitated obstacle and progress through tissue, much as alkalis. Indeed, there is no clinically significant difference in course of injury and prognosis between severe acid and alkali burns. The end result of a very severe acid injury is often indistinguishable from that of an alkali injury.\n\nThe most important agents causing acid injuries to the eye are:\n\n\nHydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF): Hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a weak inorganic acid but a strong solvent, widely used in industries. HF is used in polishing and etching of glass and silicone, in the pickling or chemical milling of metals, and in the refining of uranium, tantalum, and berrylium. In the semiconductor industry it is essential in the manufacture of silicon chips.\n\n\n\tHF produces severe ocular injury because of its high degree of activity in dissolving cellular membranes. It chelates calcium/ magnesium ions and penetrates rapidly due to its low molecular weight. It is highly toxic so that as little as 7 ml of HF, or 2.5% burn of the body surface, is sufficient to cause death from uncontrolled hypocalcaemia.\u00a0\n\n\tIt is found either in pure form or mixed with agents like nitric acid, ammonium difluoride, and acetic acid.\n\n\nSulphuric acid (H2SO4): Sulphuric acid is commonly used in batteries and also as industrial chemical. The most common cause of acid burns is sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid produces injuries varying in degree from mild to very severe. Most of the injuries, especially the more severe ones, occur as a result of battery explosions. Hydrogen and oxygen are produced by electrolysis when sulphuric acid combines with water in the battery. This gaseous mixture explodes on contact with flame. Matches or cigarette lighters used as illumination sources or sparks produced by jumper cables are the most common modes of ignition. Injuries that result from battery explosions are usually combination of acid burn and contusion from particulate matter, but may also show laceration or intraocular foreign body penetration.\n\n\n\tInjury with sulphuric acid may be compounded by thermal burns from heat generated by the reaction of acid with water on the corneal tear film. Dissolution of concentrated sulphuric acid in water results in release of heat, which causes tissues charring.\n\n\nSulphurous acid (H2SO3): Sulphur dioxide (SO2) forms H2SO3 when it combines with water in the eye. It may be present as sulphurous anhydride or sulphurous oxide; a fruit and vegetable preservative, bleach, and refrigerant. Sulphurous acid denatures protein and inactivate various enzymes. Sulphurous acid penetrates the tissue easily, because it is highly soluble in lipid and water.\n\n\n\tAt first, visual acuity is not severely affected after exposure to sulphurous acid, but it worsens greatly over hours to days as the ocular condition deteriorates.\n\n\nHydrochloric acid (HCl): Hydrochloric acid (present in gastric juices as well) is used in household cleaning and in production of plastics. Fumes of hydrogen chloride gas, act as irritant to the eye and produce profuse tearing which serves to limit ocular damage. At high concentrations and with prolonged exposure, liquid HCl produces severe ocular damage.\n\nNitric acid (HNO3): Injuries produced by nitric acid (HNO3) are similar to those produced by HCl, except that the opacity in epithelium produced by nitric acid is yellowish rather than white, as it is in other types of acid burns.\n\nChromic acid: Chromic acid is a strong agent derived from chromic oxide and chromium trioxide. Ocular injuries caused by chromic acid result from exposure to droplets of the acid in the chrome-plating industry. It produces chronic conjunctival inflammation and a brown discolouration of the epithelium, in the exposed interpalpebral fissure.\n\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH): Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a relatively weak organic acid, and is also known as vinegar and glacial acetic acid. The various forms of acetic acid, especially vinegar, typically produce only minor ocular damage, unless exposure is prolonged. Exposure to a solution in strength more than10% produces severe injury due to corrosive action, unless the time of exposure is exceedingly short. \u2018Essence of vinegar\u2019 (80% acetic acid) and glacial acetic acid (90%) are the most concentrated forms of acetic acid, and most likely to produce severe ocular injury.\n\n\nOther toxic chemicals: \n\n\tOther types of ocular chemical injuries are usually less severe than alkali and acid injuries.\n\nLacrimatory agents: Lacrimatory agents are aerosol dispersed chemicals which produce ocular irritation.\n\nCommon lacrimatory agents are:\n\n\nTear gas: Common agents used in tear gas are chloroacetophenone, chlorobenzylidene nalononitrile or dibenzoxazepine. Tear gas is used in riot control. Exposure to these chemicals causes ocular stinging, pain, excessive watering and inability to open eyes.\n\nChemical Mace (nonlethal spray containing purified tear gas and chemical solvent): Chemical Mace and similar compounds can cause minor to severe ocular injury, depending on a number of factors. The ocular injury associated with the original Chemical Mace is caused by the lacrimator chloroacetophenone.Degree of severity depends upon proximity of spray can to the eye, quantity of chemical entering the eye, duration of exposure, state of normal reflex mechanisms, and the mechanism of propelling the chemical.Extensive exposure leads to damage including loss of ocular surface epithelium, severe persistent stromal oedema, presumably secondary to endothelial damage, stromal clouding, and corneal neovascularisation.\n\t\t\u00a0\n\nPepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum): Pepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum) is used for riot control or self defence. Exposure to these chemicals causes ocular stinging, pain, excessive watering and inability to open eyes.\n\nMustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide): Mustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide) is a poisonous agent used as a chemical warfare agent. It causes irritation of conjunctiva and sore sticky eyes on exposure or a chronic and delayed mustard gas keratitis manifesting as recurrent corneal erosions.\n\n\nChemicals and Festivals in India:\n\nHoli: The colourful festival of Holi is celebrated in Phalgun month of Indian calendar, which falls in February end or month of March, every year. It is also known as festival of colours. Instead of using natural colours, people mix harmful chemicals in colours. Most of these chemical colours are oxidised metals or industrial dyes mixed with inferior quality oil e.g. engine oil. Many water colours have an alkaline base which is harmful.\n\nChemicals used to impart different colours may be:\n\n\nCopper sulphate: It imparts green colour.\n\nChromium iodide: It imparts purple colour.\n\nAluminium bromide: It produces white to yellowish red shade to the colour.\n\nMercury sulphide: Mercury sulphide gives red colour.\n\nPowdered glass: Powdered glass is used to produce shiny colour.\n\n\nDiwali (Deepavali): Diwali is an important Indian festival celebrated by lighting lamps and bursting crackers. Diwali festival also marks end of Ashwin and beginning of Kartik month of Indian calendar and it falls in the month of October or November. The chemicals released by the firecrackers are harmful.\n\nChemical in firework includes:\n\n\nSulphur dioxide.\n\nCadmium.\n\nCopper.\n\nLead.\n\nMagnesium.\n\nNitrate.\n\nNitrite.\n\n\n\tMagnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares. The combination of thermal and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury.\n\n\tFirecrackers release chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPathophysiology:\n\nAlkalis:\n\n\tThe severity of an ocular chemical injury is determined by the ability of the chemical to penetrate the eye. Alkalis, characteristically, penetrate the eye more rapidly than acids.\n\n\tThe hydroxyl anion (OH) saponifies plasma membranes, resulting in cell disruption and death, while the cation is responsible for the penetration by the alkali. Stronger alkalis are associated with more rapid penetration and the penetration rate increases in ascending order from calcium hydroxide, Potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide to ammonium hydroxide. Changes in aqueous humour pH are observed within a few seconds of contact with ammonium hydroxide and within 3-5 minutes after sodium hydroxide injury. Irreversible tissue damage occurs when the pH rises above 11.5.\n\n\tIn injuries with alkalis, cations react with the carboxyl (COOH) groups of stromal collagen and glycosa-aminoglycans. Hydration of glycosa-aminoglycans results in loss of clarity of the stroma, whereas, hydration of collagen fibrils causes distortion of trabecular meshwork and the release of prostaglandins, these sequelae combine to produce rise in intraocular pressure (IOP).\n\nAcids:\n\n\tIn general, acids penetrate the corneal stroma much less readily than alkalis. The hydrogen ion mediates damage due to pH alteration, while the anion causes precipitation and denaturation of proteins in the corneal epithelium and anterior stroma. Precipitation of the epithelial proteins produces a degree of protection by providing a physical barrier against further penetration. However, when an acid penetrates the stroma, the damage to ocular structures is similar to that observed in alkali injury.\n\nAcid injury produces:\n\n\n\t\tPrecipitation of extracellular glycosa-aminoglycans.\n\n\t\tCorneal opacification.\n\n\t\tDistortion of the trabecular meshwork.\n\n\t\tChanges in anterior chamber pH.\n\n\t\tDamage to anterior chamber structures.\n\n\t\tReduced aqueous ascorbate levels.\n\n\t\tVascular damage resulting in ischaemic injury.\n\n\n\tBoth acids and bases may mediate osmolar damage to the cornea. Chemical damage may initiate large changes in osmolarity, which gives rise to cellular dysfunction and destruction. There is little protection against a variety of chemical and toxic insults due to limited buffering capacity of the cornea. In the event that the buffering capacity is exceeded, there is an immediate cessation of biochemical activity e.g. protein synthesis.\n\nInjury, repair and differentiation:\n\nOcular surface:\n\n\tFollowing injury, recovery is dependent upon centripetal migration of cells from the most proximal region of viable epithelium. The extent of the injury determines the source of regenerating epithelium. Epithelial defect involving small area, or the entirety of cornea are replenished by adjacent corneal epithelium and limbus, respectively. In the event of complete corneal and limbal epithelial loss, the conjunctiva is the only source of regenerating epithelium. The source of regenerating epithelium influences the rate of re-epithelialisation and the type of restored epithelium.\n\nFactors retarding rate of re-epithelialisation, following chemical injury:\n\n\n\t\tRobust and persistent inflammatory response.\n\n\t\tStructural damage to the epithelial basement membrane.\n\n\n\tNon-healing corneal epithelial wounds pose a significant risk as they expose the cornea to potential microbial infection.\n\nStroma:\n\n\tSevere chemical injuries deplete stromal keratocytes, and initiate collagenolytic process which degrade collagen fibrils. These processes disrupt structural integrity and may result in corneal ulceration and perforation. Keratocytes are important for maintenance and regeneration of the corneal stroma. Following corneal injury, keratocytes migrate into areas of damaged stroma from adjacent tissue. Keratocytes are responsible for collagen synthesis. Collagen production is maximal between days 7 and 56, with a peak at about day 21 after injury. Collagen synthesis requires ascorbate and thus, may be significantly impaired following severe chemical injury.\n\nInflammation:\n\n\tChemical injury to the eye is associated with release of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into injured tissue. Regulation of this inflammatory response is crucial, since a robust and prolonged inflammatory response may affect wound healing.\n\n\tSevere chemical injuries are characterised by two waves of inflammation; the first wave occurs in the first 24 hours and the second wave begins at approximately 7 days and peaks 2 to 3 weeks after injury. The intensity of the first wave may be critical for the recruitment of the second wave. The second wave of inflammation coincides with the period of maximal corneal degradation and repair, and may facilitate sterile enzymatic digestion of the corneal stroma. Sterile ulceration is associated with the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The exclusion of inflammatory cells from the corneal stroma is associated with cessation of sterile ulceration.", "diagnosis":"The severity of eye injury depends upon:\n\n\n\t\tToxicity of the Chemical.\n\n\t\tDuration contact of chemical with eye.\n\n\t\tDepth of penetration.\n\n\t\tArea of involvement.\n\n\nDiagnosis requires:\n\nClinical history: Patient should be asked for:\n\n\n\t\tWhen the injury occurred.\n\n\t\tWhether the eye was rinsed and for how long.\n\n\t\tMechanism of injury (was the chemical under pressure).\n\n\t\tThe nature of chemical.\n\n\t\tWhether there was any eye protection or not.\n\n\nClinical Examination: \n\nPrior to clinical eye examination, pH of both the eyes should be checked. Eye must be irrigated to bring the pH to a safer range between 7 and 7.2.\n\n\tEarly assessment includes careful documentation of the extent and severity of limbal, corneal and bulbar/ palpebral conjunctival involvement, since it provides baseline reference in subsequent evaluation and treatment.\n\n\tPalpebral fissures should be examined and fornices should be swept to remove a retained particulate matter, which can cause persistent damage. Eye should be examined under fluorescein dye. Intraocular pressure should be documented as well to exclude any rise.\n\n\tEmergency treatment of the chemically injured eye must precede any attempt at classification. Once the condition has been stabilised, determine the anticipated course of the chemical injury by examining the critical features. Understanding and documenting the salient features of an alkali injury of the eye permits proper classification so that appropriate treatment can be initiated and accurate prognosis deduced. Photographic documentation may be obtained, if possible.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClinical grading of chemical Injuries:\n\nEpithelial defect: Measure the size and draw the shape of the defect after instilling 2% fluorescein dye. Include any conjunctival epithelial defects as well, particularly concerning the palisades of Vogt (limbal stem cells). Document all epithelial defects, including those extending into the fornices of the eye.\n\nCorneal stromal opacity: Grade corneal stromal opacity on the basis of penlight examination:\n\n\nGrade 0: Grade 0 is clear cornea.\n\nGrade 1: Grade 1 has mild corneal haze.\n\nGrade 2: Grade 2 represents mild to moderate opacity.\n\nGrade 3: Grade 3 has moderate opacity.\n\nGrade 4: Grade 4 represents moderate to severe opacity. Details of iris trabeculae can be seen and pupils are visible.\n\nGrade 5: Grade 5 severe corneal opacity, pupils are not visible with penlight.\n\n\nPerilimbal ischaemia: To document perilimbal ischaemia, note the clock hours where the conjunctiva is whitened. The conjunctiva and episclera are devoid of blood vessels in these areas. This whitening should not be confused with less severe injury, where there is chemosis and thrombosed blood vessels, but some of the conjunctiva is still viable. Perilimbal whitening is a useful parameter by which the extent of corneal stem cell damage, and indirectly, injury of the underlying ciliary body and trabecular meshwork, may be judged. Documentation of these findings allows for more accurate determination of the necessity for corneal stem cell transplantation.\n\nAdnexa: Measure and document the blinking pattern, corneal exposure, and/or lagophthalmos.\n\n\tThese measurements and findings can be applied to the classification of alkali injuries as described by Hughes, and later modified by Ballen (1963), Roper- Hall (1965) and Pfister et al (1982). This classification, with accompanying drawings and photographs, represents the span of damage encountered after alkali injury. The accuracy of early assessment becomes important in prognostication and treatment plans.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClassification of chemical injury to the eye:\n\nDua (2001) provides a classification of ocular surface burns giving prognosis based on corneal appearance, conjunctival involvement and analogue scale recording the amount of limbal involvement in clock hours of affected limbus/ percentage of conjunctival involvement. The conjunctival involvement should be calculated only for the bulbar conjunctiva, up to and including the conjunctival fornices.\n\n\nGrade I: In Grade I, there is 0 clock hours of limbal involvement, 0% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0/0%, and the prognosis is very good.\n\nGrade II: In Grade II, there is less than 3 clock hours of limbal involvement, less than 30% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0.1- 3/ 1- 29.9%, and the prognosis is good.\n\nGrade III: In Grade III, there is between 3- 6 clock hours of limbal involvement, 30- 50% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 3.1- 6/ 31- 50%, and the prognosis is good.\n\nGrade IV: In Grade IV, there is between 6- 9 clock hours of limbal involvement, 50- 75% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 6.1- 9/ 51- 75%, and the prognosis is good to guarded.\n\nGrade V: In Grade V, there is between 9- 12 clock hours of limbal involvement, 75- 100% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 9.1- 11.9/ 75- 100%, and the prognosis is guarded to poor.\n\nGrade VI: In Grade VI, there is total limbal (12 clock hours) involvement, total conjunctival (100%) involvement, analogue scale reading of 12/ 100%, and the prognosis is very poor.\n\n\nMcCulley (1987) has divided the clinical course of chemical injury in four distinct phases:\n\n\n\t\tImmediate.\n\n\t\tAcute phase (0- 7 days).\n\n\t\tEarly reparative phase (7- 21 days).\n\n\t\tLate reparative phase (after 21 days).\n\n\n\tThe clinical findings immediately following chemical exposure may be used to assess the severity and prognosis of the injury.\n\nHughes (1946) classification (modified by Ballen in 1963, Roper- Hall in 1965 and Pfister et al in 1982) provides a prognostic guideline based on corneal appearance and extent of limbal ischaemia. The Roper-hall classification system was introduced in the mid-1960s and is the most established and commonly applied system.\n\n\nGrade I injury: In Grade I injury, there is corneal epithelial damage, no corneal opacity, no limbal ischaemia, and the prognosis is good.\n\nGrade II injury: In Grade II injury, the cornea is hazy but the iris details are visible. There is also ishaemia involving less than one third of the limbus and the prognosis is good.\n\nGrade III injury: In Grade III injury, there is total epithelial loss, stromal haze with obscuration of iris details, ischaemia of one third to one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is guarded.\n\nGrade IV injury: In Grade IV injury, the cornea is opaque with no view of the iris or pupil, the ischaemia is greater than one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is poor.\n\n\nIn the acute phase (during first week), Grade I injuries heal while Grade II injuries slowly recover with corneal clarity. Grade III and Grade IV injuries have little or no epithelialisation, with no collagenolysis or vascularisation. Intraocular pressure may be elevated due to inflammation or decreased due to damage to ciliary body.\n\nDuring early reparative phase (7- 21 days), in Grade II injuries, re- epithelialisation is completed with clearing of opacification. In more severe cases, there may not be a change in clinical appearance and there may be delayed or arrested re- epithelialisation. Keratocyte proliferation occurs with production of collagen and collagenase, resulting in progressive thinning with potential of perforation.\n\nIn late reparative phase, re- epithelialisation patterns divide injured eyes into two groups:\n\n\nFirst group: In the first group, epithelialisation is complete or is nearly complete with sparing of limbal stem cells. Corneal anaesthesia, goblet cell/ mucinous abnormalities, and irregular epithelial basement membrane regeneration may persist.\n\nSecond group: In the second group, limbal stem cell damage results in corneal re- epithelialisation from conjunctival epithelium. This group has the worst prognosis with severe ocular surface damage characterised by vascularisation and scarring, goblet cell/ mucinous deficiency, and recurrent and persistent erosions. There may be cicatricial entropion (inward turning of eyelid), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), and symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation. A fibro-vascular pannus may form if there is no ulceration, and it compromises visual rehabilitation.\n\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\n\t\tThermal burns to the eyes.\n\n\t\tUltraviolet radiation keratitis.\n\n\t\tOther causes of corneal opacification.\n\n\t\tOcular cicatricial pemphigoid.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nPreparation for vision restoration: Preparation for vision restoration must begin immediately after the injury. Deliberate and timely treatment determines successful outcomes in the rehabilitative process.\n\n\tIn succession, management consists of emergency treatment, pressure control, suppression of inflammation, enhancing stromal repair, and establishing eyelid-globe congruity during the early days, weeks, and months after the injury.\n\n\tTopical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical beta blockers continue to form the mainstay of intraocular pressure control. Fibroblast inhibiting mitomycin C may improve the success of filtration surgery for glaucoma. Drainage procedures may be done if one or more filtration surgeries fail.\n\n\tOperative procedures include amniotic membrane transplant, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants, keratoplasty, large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty, and keratoprosthesis.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\nEmergency management:\n\n\nIrrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual chemical debris from the eye. The objectives are to minimise penetration of the chemical into the anterior chamber, and to remove a potential reservoir for ongoing injury. Immediate copious irrigation should begin at the scene of the incident and this is an important intervention. Irrigation with the lids kept open should be initiated and maintained at least for 30 minutes, which may require 1- 2 liters of solution. Irrigation should be continued until pH neutralisation is achieved. Patients with immediate copious irrigation have less severe injury, as compared to eyes which are not irrigated. Although there may be an advantage in the use of amphoteric buffering solution, any available neutral irrigation solution may be used in emergency. Solutions available for irrigation include normal saline, normal saline with bicarbonate, Ringer\u2019s lactate, balanced salt solution (BSS), and BSS- plus. No therapeutic differences have been noted among these solutions. After copious irrigation, necrotic corneal epithelium should be d\u00e9brided to promote re-epithelialisation.\n\n\t\tWhere possible, topical anaesthetic drops should be instilled to reduce pain and blepharospasm, thereby facilitating irrigation. Remove all particulate matter, and this may require eyelid eversion (double eversion may be necessary) and cleaning of the fornices. Lime particles should be removed with forceps and a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may help with the removal of stubborn particles. Few patients may require general anaesthetic or sedation to effectively remove particulate matter.\n\nAqueous humour replacement: External irrigation is of limited value in eliminating chemicals once they have reached the anterior chamber. Role of paracentesis (removal of aqueous from anterior chamber) and irrigation of the anterior chamber is controversial. Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to consider aqueous humour replacement in patients with severe injuries presenting within first two hours following exposure.\n\n\nAcute and Reparative phases:\n\n\tAfter irrigation, better outcomes may be expected with prompt re-epithelialisation, while delayed or absent re-epithelialisation may require surgical intervention.\n\n\nCorticosteroid therapy: Intensive corticosteroid therapy during first two weeks decreases the inflammatory response (which can delay epithelial migration), and thus enhances re-epithelialisation. Corticosteroids use during first 10 days of injury has no adverse effect on outcome. Prolonged use of corticosteroids beyond two weeks may lead to stromal ulceration, since steroids blunt stromal wound repair by decreasing keratocyte migration and collagen synthesis.\n\nMedroxyprogesterone: Medroxyprogesterone is a pogestational steroid that has weak anti- inflammatory activity as compared to corticosteroids. Medroxyprogesterone inhibits collagenase but, unlike corticosteroids, minimally suppresses stromal wound repair. Medroxyprogesterone may be substituted for corticosteroid after two weeks if worsening corneal ulceration is of concern.\n\nTopical and systemic sodium ascorbate (10%): Topical and systemic sodium ascorbate (10%) replenish depleted levels from the aqueous humour, following injury with alkali. Ascorbate is a cofactor in the rate- limiting step of collagen synthesis, and thus decreases the incidence of stromal ulceration. The molecular events responsible for the failure of collagen to assemble properly occur because of the deficiency of the reducing agent ascorbate.\n\nTopical Citrate (10%): Topical buffered citrate is a calcium chelator that decreases intracellular levels of calcium in neutrophils and thus impairs chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and release of lysosomal enzymes. Topical citrate also reduces corneal ulceration and perforation of eye.\n\nOral tetracyclines: Oral tetracyclines offer protection against collagenolytic degradation.\n\n\n\tTopical antibiotics may be required to prevent superadded infections. Cycloplegics provide comfort to the eye. Artificial tears, preferably preservative free, may provide general lubrication for ocular comfort.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tSurgical intervention that may help stabilising the ocular surface in severe chemical injury includes:\n\n\nTenonplasty: Tenonplasty attempts to re-establish limbal vascularity in severe injuries and to promote re- epithelialisation. In this, all necrotic conjunctival and episcleral tissues are excised. Tenon\u2019s capsule is dissected with blunt instrument, and the resultant flap with its preserved blood supply is advanced to the limbus.\n\nTissue adhesives (tissue glue): Tissue adhesives preserve integrity in the event of corneal thinning with impending or actual perforation of the globe. This is usually accompanied by the application of a soft bandage contact lens, which prevents glue dislodgement. Tissue glue can stop further melting by excluding inflammatory cells and their mediators. Tissue adhesives also provide a means of delaying penetrating keratoplasty.\n\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be used as supplement to surgical procedures where coverage of raw surfaces or suppression of inflammation is required. Amniotic membrane has anti-angiogenic (inhibitors of blood vessels growth) and anti-inflammatory proteins capable of suppressing the inflammatory response. Amniotic membrane can create a new basement membrane and promote epithelial healing. Amniotic membrane might be applied very early after a chemical injury following emergency services, usually weeks later. Despite benefits, amniotic membrane cannot replace the need for corneal stem cells.\n\nCorneal stem cell transplantation: Replacement of the corneal stem cells lost due to injury is important in the restoration of an intact and normal corneal epithelial cell layer. These primitive, slow-cycling stem cells are located in the limbal area. \u00a0\n\n\n\tMonocular injuries allow for procurement of stem cells from the uninjured eye. When the injury is bilateral, Pfister (1993) showed that allografted limbal tissue was capable of restoring the stem cell population from an unrelated donor. Allografted corneal stem cells must be protected from the recipient immune process by systemic immune-suppression e.g. cyclosporine.\n\n\nCorneal transplantation (Keratoplasty):\n\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Success in restorative corneal surgery is governed by:\n\n\t- \u00a0Lid-globe congruity with normal blinking and the absence of corneal exposure. Preparatory procedures to lyse symblepharon, expand cul-de-sacs, and to eliminate lagophthalmos are often required to re-establish normal lid functioning.\n\n\t- \u00a0Quality and quantity of tear film.\n\n\t- \u00a0The presence of epithelial stem cells phenotypic for cornea.\n\n\t- \u00a0The absence of any current ulceration, inflammation, and/or uncontrolled glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma must also be controlled with medications or filtration surgery.\n\n\t- \u00a0Flawless surgical technique.\n\n\t- \u00a0Fresh corneal transplant tissue.\n\n\tThe value of preoperative use of LASER for blood vessels at the limbus in high-risk patients is controversial, but at least it reduces bleeding at the time of surgery.\n\n\tIf corneal surgery is delayed 18 months to 2 years after a chemical burn, it increases the chances of success, especially without pre-existing ulceration, perforation, or glaucoma.\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty refers to the full- thickness replacement of the affected cornea with a healthy donor. Penetrating keratoplasty may be used to provide tectonic support (such as in corneal thinning and perforation), and to improve visual outcome (such as in the replacement of corneal scarring).\n\nLarge-diameter penetrating keratoplasty: Replacement of the entire cornea and adjacent stem cells by large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty may be performed. One potential danger might be that such large transplants might interfere with the trabecular outflow channels and hence increase the likelihood of glaucoma. Proximity to the limbal blood vessels makes an immune rejection more likely.\n\nLarge-diameter lamellar keratoplasty: A very promising technique in corneal transplantation for chemical injuries includes the use of 12 or 13 mm lamellar corneal transplants, along with the limbal epithelial stem cell population. Smaller lamellar transplants are useful to fill in deep corneal ulcerations, descemetoceles, or frank corneal perforations.\n\n\nKeratoprosthesis (Artificial cornea): In the most severe cases, implantation of a keratoprosthesis might afford the only means by which vision can be restored.\n\n\nIndications for keratoprosthesis are:\n\n\t- \u00a0Corneas exhibiting exuberant vascularity.\n\n\t- \u00a0Repeated failures of fresh transplanted corneal tissue.\n\n\t- \u00a0Chronic limbal stem cell deficiency.\n\n\t- \u00a0Inability to restore normal lid anatomy.\n\n\tThe operation is usually advised in patients with severe bilateral injuries where serviceable vision is not present in either eye. A surprising degree of success may be achieved with keratoprosthesis. Critical to the visual outcome of a keratoprosthesis is the control of intraocular pressure at all times after the chemical injury.\n\n\nConjunctival transplantation: Conjunctival transplantation is a means of restoring conjunctival fornices following fibrosis. This provides compatible tissue with a basement membrane, unlike other mucosal replacements. The procedure involves taking a sample of upper bulbar conjunctiva from the contralateral (other uninvolved) eye.\n\nBuccal and Nasal mucosa transplant: Buccal mucosa grafts may be used to treat symblepharon (adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), distichiasis (partial or complete second row of eyelashes), or entropion. The graft is usually obtained from the posterior aspect of the upper or lower lip. The advantage of nasal mucosal grafts lies in the ability to obtain large sized grafts.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nStages of ocular recovery following chemical injury (Colby, 2010):\n\n\nInitial phase (day 0): Clinical findings relate to the severity of injury and can be graded according to degree of limbal, corneal and conjunctival involvement.\n\nAcute phase (day 0- 7): Epithelial re-growth begins to occur if there is sufficient amount of undamaged limbal stem cells. Treatment should be directed at encouraging growth while suppressing inflammation.\n\nPhase of early repair (days 7- 21): Corneal/ conjunctival epithelium and keratocytes proliferate during this stage. Mild injuries show complete re-epithelialisation while more severe injuries can have persistent epithelial defects. Activity of collagenases peaks by day 14- 21 while collagen synthesis continues. Treatment should attempt to maximise collagen synthesis while minimising collagenase activity.\n\nPhase of late repair (after day 21): In mild injuries, where the limbal stem cell population is intact, repair is completed. In injuries, where there is focal stem cell loss, there may be a focal growth of conjunctiva on the cornea. In more severe injuries, there is delayed re-epithelialisation of the cornea, ultimately leading to either repopulation by conjunctival epithelium or stromal ulceration and permanent scarring. In cases of severe limbal damage, despite optimal management, the eye cannot be salvaged.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nManagement of exposure to lacrimatory agents:\n\n\nTear gas and Chemical Mace: Following exposure to tear gas and Chemical Mace, thorough rinsing/ irrigation provides immense relief.\n\nPepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum): Irrigation with fresh water, although recommended, has little effect as capsicin is not soluble in water. Flushing the eye with a solution containing half liquid antacid (of aluminium or magnesium hydroxide base) and half water (LAW) is more effective.\n\nMustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide): Prompt irrigation of eyes with running water or normal saline is useful. Topical antibiotic, cycloplegic and lubricant may be used for associated corneal erosions.\n\n\n\tExposure to chemicals used for festivals in India also requires thorough rinsing/ irrigation with running water or normal saline for relief.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tThe prognosis for severe injury is typically poor and may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium, cornea and anterior segment. However, in recent years, the prognosis of severe ocular burns has improved, with advances in the understanding of the physiology of the cornea and the resultant development of enhanced medical and surgical treatments. The final visual prognosis is influenced by:\n\n\n\t\tThe nature of the chemical insult.\n\n\t\tThe extent of ocular damage.\n\n\t\tThe timing and efficacy of treatment.", "complications":"Potential complications and sequelae of chemical injuries to the eye are:\n\nLids: \n\n\n\t\tPosterior displacement of meibomian orifices.\n\n\t\tTrichiasis.\n\n\t\tCicatricial ectropion.\n\n\t\tCicatricial entropion.\n\n\t\tLagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely).\n\n\t\tAnkyloblepharon (adhesion of eyelids to each other).\n\n\nOcular surface:\n\n\n\t\tDry eye.\n\n\t\tLoss of goblet cells.\n\n\t\tDamage to lacrimal system.\n\n\t\tCorneal scarring.\n\n\t\tCorneal neovascularisation.\n\n\t\tLimbal stem cell deficiency.\n\n\t\tSymblepharon.\n\n\t\tCorneal melt.\n\n\t\tCorneal opacity.\n\n\t\tIntraocular inflammation.\n\n\t\tRecurrent corneal erosions.\n\n\t\tNon healing epithelial defects.\n\n\t\tMicrobial keratitis.\n\n\nElevated IOP:\n\n\n\t\tSecondary glaucoma.\n\n\nIntraocular structures:\n\n\n\t\tFixed dilated pupil.\n\n\t\tIris ischaemia.\n\n\t\tCiliary body shut down with secondary hypotony (reduced intraocular pressure).\n\n\t\tCataract.\n\n\t\tRetinal detachment.\n\n\t\tPhthisis bulbi (shrunken globe).", "Prevention":"There is no safe and effective vaccine currently available for human use.

 {"id":68, "name":"Deafness", "intro":"A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019.\u00a0 On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n\tTo date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.\n\n\t(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).\n\n\tThe precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019\u2011nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.\n\n\tEpidemiological evidence shows that 2019\u2011nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019\u2011nCoV are similar.\n\n\tAccording to WHO, additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.\n\n\tOn 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019\u2011nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).\n\n\tCOVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020.

 {"id":69, "name":"Dementia", "intro":"Computer vision syndrome (CVS), also referred to as digital eye strain,\u00a0describes eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use.\n\n\tThe main visual symptoms reported by visual display terminal (VDT) users include eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, thus termed the phrase \u2018computer vision syndrome\u2019 (CVS). Vision problems and symptoms associated with the use of the eyes are the most frequently occurring health problems among VDT users. CVS not only causes pain and discomfort to the individual, but also reduces overall efficiency by reducing the time that a person can effectively work.\n\n\tMajority of VDT patients had symptoms that were different than other near-point workers, especially as related to glare, lighting, and spectacle requirements. Greater frequency and severity of symptoms were also noted. One study shows higher degree of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) in symptomatic computer users than in computer users who have lesser degrees of ocular surface complaints.\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration of the US Government (OSHA) has defined CVS as a \u2018complex of eye and vision problems that are experienced during and related to computer use; it is repetitive strain disorder that appears to be growing rapidly, with some studies estimating that 90% US workers using computers from more than three hours per day experience CVS in some form\u2019 (Nilsen, 2005). Anshel (2006) have defined CVS as the \u2018complex of eye and vision problems related to near work, which are experienced during or related to computer use\u2019. Chakrabarti (2007) defined CVS as the \u2018excessive viewing of visual display terminal (VDT) screens without proper attention to practical visual hygiene\u2019. The American Optometric Association (AOA) has defined CVS as \u2018a complex of eye and vision problems related to activities, which stress the near vision and which are experienced in relation or during the use of computers\u2019. It has now been concluded that CVS is characterised by visual symptoms which result from interaction with a computer display or its environment. In most cases the symptoms occur because the visual demands of the task exceed the visual abilities of the individual for comfortable performance of task.\n\n\tOffice work involves a range of activities including typing, reading, and writing. Each activity was adequately varied in the requirements of posture and vision. Computers have combined these tasks to where most can be performed without moving from the desktop, thereby improving quality, production, and efficiency. The popularity and affordability of personal computers with the internet capabilities at home introduced more computer users.\n\n\tStudies have not clearly indicated a negative effect on computer user due to radiation levels from VDTs. VDTs are known to emit many types of radiation, including soft X-radiation, optical radiation, radiofrequency radiation, very low frequency radiation, and extremely low frequency radiation. Most women in offices, who work with VDTs, do not increase their risk of miscarriage.\n\n\tIt may well be that high computer usage raises the number of dry eye sufferers and/or increases the severity of symptoms, but studies have not produced any direct comparison of groups that would allow us to conclude that computer use bears a long- term causal relation to ocular surface disease. There needs to be more prospective studies to elucidate direct relationship between ocular surface disease (e.g. MGD) and CVS.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome?sso=y\n\nhttp://www.sankaranethralaya.org/patient-care-cvc.html\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00834.x/full\n\nhttp://www.jcor.in/article.asp?issn=2320-3897;year=2014;volume=2;issue=1;spage=61;epage=68;aulast=Bali\n\nhttp://www.academicjournals.org/journal/MPR/article-full-text-pdf/0905F9948599\n\nhttp://medresearch.in/index.php/IJMRR/article/view/72/233\n\nhttp://www.jmgims.co.in/article.asp?issn=0971-9903;year=2015;volume=20;issue=2;spage=134;epage=136;aulast=Raja\n\nBenitez-del-Castillo Jose M, Lemp Michael A.

Playing electronic games for long periods, especially in children has also been linked to obesity.", "causes":"Risk factors for CVS include:\n\nI. Factors influencing surface disease:\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\tThere are several factors that contribute to CVS and dry eye syndrome (DES). They include the following:\n\n\nEnvironmental factors: The cornea is very sensitive to drying and chemical imbalances from environmental factors such as dry air, ventilation fans, electrostatic build up, airborne paper dust, laser and photocopy toner, and building contaminants.\n\nReduced blink rate: Most individuals blink normally 10- 15 times/ minute. Studies have shown that the blink rate at the computer is significantly less. A reduced blink rate at the VDT contributes to a poor-quality tear film and temporary as well as long-term stress upon the cornea and ocular surface. This results in symptoms of DES.\n\nDuration of computer use: Longer duration of the computer work tends to result in long-lasting complaints that persist, even when the work is completed.\n\nHeight and inclination of monitor: Increased odds ratio (eye strain) for certain eye symptoms is observed when the computer monitor is kept at about the eye level instead of below the eye level. The VDT should be at least 5 to 6 inches below the straight line of the viewer\u2019s vision. Such measures reduce not only dry eye, but also the severity of the spasm of neck muscles. OSHA has recommended that the center of computer monitor should normally be located 15 to 20 cm below the horizontal eye level and that the entire visual area of the display screen should be located such that the downward viewing angle is greater than 60 degrees.\n\nTaking frequent breaks: Taking frequent breaks from computer use is shown to increase the efficiency because the breaks relax eye accommodative system, thus decreasing eye fatigue and headache.\n\nDistance of VDT from the eyes: Distance of VDT from the eyes is an important risk factor for CVS. Closer the VDT to the eyes, it is more difficult for the eyes to accommodate. Excess accommodation results in overwork on ciliary muscles which manifest as eye fatigue and headache.\n\nIncreased exposure due to position of monitor: Normally reading of text on paper is done while looking downwards and it results in the eyelid covering a good deal of the front surface of the eye. This covering minimises the evaporation of tears. On the other hand, computer users look at their reading material in straight ahead gaze. This result in a wider opening between the eyelids, and an increased surface area exposed to the effects of evaporation.\n\nGender: The prevalence of DES is twice as frequent in females as compared to males.\n\nAge: Tear production normally decreases with age. Although DES can occur at any age in both men and women.\n\nMenopause: Hormonal changes have been identified as contributing to DES. Postmenopausal women represent the group of individuals affected most by DES. \u00a0Sometimes it is difficult to assess the relative contributions of menopause and ageing.\n\nSystemic diseases and disease syndromes: DES is associated with various systemic diseases. In the case of Sj\u04e7gren\u2019s syndrome, dry mouth and rheumatoid arthritis can assist in making the diagnosis. Several autoimmune diseases also have association with DES.\n\nSystemic medications: There are several systemic medications which contribute to ocular drying. Most prominent among them are diuretics, antihistamines, and anti-hypertensives.\n\nSpectacle wear: CVS with eye redness has significant association with the use of spectacles.\n\nContact lens wear: Contact lens comfort is highly dependent on the fit of the lens and lubrication of the eye. If the eye is dry, the lenses dry easily and adhere to the upper eyelid during the blink. This \u2018friction effect\u2019 from DES produces discomfort.\n\nCosmetics: Cosmetics may block the openings of the oil-secreting meibomian glands and create debris and inflammation. This leads to rapid evaporation of the water component of the tear film and deposition of foreign bodies from cosmetics in the tear film or on the ocular surface with resultant discomfort.\n\nCholesterol: There may be statistically significant decreased prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with moderate to severe MGD. The cause of this is unknown, but the findings suggest that elevated HDL may be a risk factor for the development of MGD, despite being known as \u2018good cholesterol\u2019 with its cardio-protective effects.\n\n\nII. Visual effects of display features:\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\nDisplay quality: Visual performance is affected by a number of display parameters, such as character size, structure, and style; and by image contrast and stability.\u00a0\n\n\n\tThe images produced on a VDT consists of thousands of tiny, bright spots (pixels) or horizontal lines (rasters), which collectively form unresolved images that blur together and lack sharp edges. The more the dots or lines displayed on a monitor to produce a picture, the sharper and clearer the image will appear. With time, the resolution of monitors has improved drastically, producing displays approaching that of typeset documents.\u00a0\n\n\tMany factors affect readability and legibility of characters on the screen. Words containing upper case in combination with lower case are more easily interpreted than all upper case documents. The spacing between characters and lines also affects picture quality. High levels of contrast and brightness are known to represent the most common causes of character blur. Screens should contain dark characters against a light background display screen, rather than the opposite. Switches from a light background hard copy to dark background display causes fatigue of the iris muscle.\n\n\nLighting and glare: Improper lighting conditions of a workstation can also adversely affect ocular comfort. Constant and bright illumination from surrounding sources of light creates reflection and glare. These problems do not produce chronic visual disorders but are sources of annoyance and possibly visual fatigue.\n\n\n\tIn cases where it is not practical to reduce surrounding light, reduction of reflections and increase in contrast may be obtained from antiglare filters.\n\n\tRecent studies demonstrate differing results in the efficacy of symptoms relief with screen filters. One recent study revealed that people who used a screen filter reported less occurrence, shorter duration, and less intensive eye and musculoskeletal complaints after one month of use. It was concluded that screen filters could improve the conditions for visual perception and thus relieve eyestrain. Another study showed that filters by themselves do not reduce the occurrence of asthenopia (rapid fatigue of the eyes). More research is needed to determine whether screen filters are effective in the relief of ocular symptoms.\n\n\nRefresh rates: The refresh rate of a VDT represents the number of times per minute (measured in Hertz) the screen is repainted to produce an image. If the refresh rate is too slow, the characters on the screen may appear to flicker. Perceived flicker has resulted in subjective complaints of annoyance, fatigue, and headache. The critical fusion frequency is the refresh rate at which humans can no longer distinguish the pulsating beams of light as separate entities. In most viewing situations, this rate is 30- 50 Hertz.\n\n\n\tStudies have shown that much higher refresh rates may decrease ocular symptoms and increase user functionality.\n\n\nRadiation: The potential of health risk concerns that radiation emissions from VDTs could be responsible for hazardous effects to the computer user. However, VDTs neither produce nor emit alpha, beta, gamma, or hard X-radiation. Small amount of soft X-rays is produced, but almost all of the radiation is contained by the glass screen of the monitor.\n\n\n\tNumerous studies have shown that there is no evidence to support that VDT operators face health hazards or have exposure to electric, magnetic, or ionizing radiation fields significantly above ambient levels.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPathophysiology:\n\n\tEye focusing mechanism in human beings responds well to images with well defined edges with good background and contrast between the background and letters. Visual work on computer involves continuous muscular activity and it includes frequent saccadic eye movements (ocular motility), accommodation (focusing) and vergence (alignment demands).\n\n\tCharacters on computer screen are made up of tiny dots called pixels. Each pixel is bright at its center and decreases in brightness towards the outer edges. This causes electronic characters to have blurred edges as compared to letters on a paper with sharply defined edges. This makes very difficult for eye to maintain focus on pixels, and the eye relaxes to focus behind the screen. This is called the resting point of accommodation (RPA) or dark focus. Thus, eye constantly relaxes to RPA and strains to refocus on to the screen thereby leading to eyestrain.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms being faced by the patients and the clinical features.\n\n\tA complete ocular surface examination is imperative to rule out local and systemic features associated with DES, blepharitis, inflammation, and lid margin disease. Patients with significant aqueous deficiency with basal or Schirmer test 1 value less than 5 mm should be evaluated.\n\nCVS and meibomian gland disease (MGD):\n\n\tThe rate at which people blink decreases by more than 60% when they stare at a computer screen, suggesting that the acute decrease in blinks can acutely increase symptoms of Dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)\u00a0.\u00a0Computer users often complain that their eyes feel dry, burning, gritty, or heavy after an extended period at VDT. Their eyes may even reflexively tear in an attempt to properly lubricate and rewet the front surface of the eye. DES may be a primary cause of ocular fatigue, such as experienced when using a VDT, where the blink rate is decreased and the exposed ocular surface area is increased. Blink rate is decreased further in dark where it is difficult to read.\n\n\tThe tear film, which overlies and protects the cornea, consists of, from anterior surface inward, a lipid layer, an aqueous gel layer, and a mucin layer. DES results from evaporation of the aqueous component. The lipid surface layer protects the aqueous layer from evaporation. It is secreted as meibum by the meibomian glands embedded in the eyelids. The normal physiological mechanism of meibum secretion is associated with blink reflex. The normal blink expresses meibum from the glands and spreads it evenly on top of the aqueous layer. Several studies have shown that computer use produces considerable reduction of the spontaneous blink rate. Hence, computer use reduces meibum secretion and exposes tear film to increased aqueous evaporation. Because the tear film is maintained by a balance of secretion of the lipid meibum layer and the aqueous layer, reduction of secretion of either results in a tear film imbalance that can lead to symptoms and signs of DES.\n\n\tAn immediate reduction in blink rate acutely alters the ocular surface because it causes poor tear spreading and dessication. Longer term reduction of blinking may alter meibomian gland. Eventually, MGD may worsen, causing further reduction of the outflow of meibum, alteration in the normal bacterial flora, increase in inflammation, and obstruction of the glands. Thus, reduced blink rate at the computer contributes to poor tear film quality and increased evaporation, which reduces the overall efficiency and comfort of work. Furthermore, the positive correlation between lifetime computer usage and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score shows that people who use the computer tend to have more significant ocular surface symptoms.\n\nCVS and asthenopia:\n\n\tMany individuals have marginal vision disorders, such as difficulties with accommodation, or binocular vision problems that do not cause symptoms when performing less demanding visual tasks.\n\n\tUse of VDT creates asthenopia or a feeling of ocular discomfort or tiredness. In fact, symptomatic visual complaints were reported by 75% of VDT operators working 6-9 hours in front of their screens compared to 50% of the other workers (Mutti et al. 1996).\n\n\tAfter working with the monitor, the most important changes are:\n\n\n\t\tDiminished power of accommodation.\n\n\t\tRemoval of the near point of convergence.\n\n\t\tDeviation or phoria for near vision.\n\n\n\tThese results suggest that the weakness of important visual functions could be the cause of eyestrain in computer operators. Prolonged work at a VDT has been reported to result in changes in both relative accommodation and vergence.\n\n\tOne study noted a high prevalence of exophoria, convergence insufficiency, and low fusional convergence among VDT workers. They also found that the accommodative amplitude decreased significantly more for VDT users than for non-users.\n\n\tVDTs are a major source of near work for many adults, but do not appear to result in losses of accommodative and vergence functions beyond the ordinary effects of age.\n\nCVS and transient myopia:\n\n\tAccommodative effort during near work is thought to be a causative factor in the development of myopia. It is clear that near work with VDTs result in a small, temporary myopic shift. In a cross-sectional comparison of VDT users and typists, VDT users experienced a myopic shift of about -0.12 Diopters after the work period, while the refractive error of typists was unchanged.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tThe treatment of CVS requires a multidirectional approach due to the variety of complaints by the users. When treating a patient, it is important to consider ocular therapy as well as adjustment of workstation and habits of users.\n\n\tLocal ocular surface disorders should be treated aggressively and on a long term basis. Eye care providers and patients need to understand the chronicity of this disorder in order to maintain compliance to treatment.\n\nTreatment includes: \n\nRestoring aqueous deficiencies with \n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lubrication.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Partial or complete punctal occlusion.\n\nShort- and long- term inflammation control with \n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical steroids.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Omega 3.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical cyclosporine A.\n\n\tIsolation technique, that is, microenvironment glasses (MEGS) or specialised contact lenses, are helpful if the patients are moderately to severely symptomatic or have significant findings of dry eye or lid margin disease on clinical examination.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nVDT positioning: Computer users often assume uncomfortable positions in order to properly view the screen which leads to pain. It is thus important to keep monitor at proper distance and height.\n\n\n\tPreviously, it was recommended that the eye should be 16- 30 inches from the screen. Recent data suggest that further distances may be more favourable to ocular symptoms. These studies suggest that distances of 35- 40 inches may produce fewer complaints of visual strain.\n\n\tIt is recommended that the screen should be placed 10-20\u02da below (or the middle of the screen 5- 6 inches below) the eye level. When the screen is higher than this level, VDT users often tilt back their heads, causing muscle strain in the neck. Lowering the monitor allows the VDT user to gaze downward, thus exposing less ocular surface to ambient air and reducing tear film loss.\n\n\nLighting: Proper lighting within the computer workstation area improve visual comfort and performance while eliminating annoyance and visual fatigue. An ideal environment would allow equalised brightness throughout the visual field. Intense fluorescent lights can be diminished by removing a few of them. Excessive window lighting should be filtered with blinds, window coverings, or window tinting.\n\n\n\tThe actual type of lighting also appears to be important. One study focused on the visual work capacity with different sources of illumination. It was found that sodium lamps were the most adequate for high functional capacity of the visual analyser.\n\n\tIt is important to position the light carefully so that it does not throw bright light into the eyes.\n\n\tAntiglare filters may not reduce symptoms of asthenopia, but have been shown to reduce glare and improve contrast from the screen. This provides an effective means to eliminate reflections and therefore improve visual comfort.\n\n\nWork breaks: It is shown that when regular breaks are implemented, work efficiency improves, which compensates for the time lost during the break. Short frequent breaks decrease in worker discomfort and increase in productivity compared to the historical 15-minute morning and afternoon breaks. A quick walk around the office provides stretching of strained and fatigued muscles and gives relaxation.\n\n\n\tLong periods of work without breaks are thought to be detrimental to ocular symptoms. Frequent breaks are recommended to restore and relax the accommodative system, thereby preventing eyestrain. It is believed that looking away at a distant object at least twice in an hour during computer usage is sufficient for prevention of visual fatigue.\n\n\nLubricating eye drops: Lubricating eye drops relieve the symptoms of dry eyes due to decreased blink rates. A tear substitute can periodically rewet the ocular surface, contribute to tear volume, and maintain the proper balance of salts and acidity while viewing a terminal. One study shows that higher viscosity eye drops may be more beneficial than balanced salt solutions. They normalised the inter-blink interval and relieved ocular discomfort more efficiently than balanced salt solutions following VDT use.\n\nCyclosporine A drops: While artificial tears are effective, cyclosporine A drops may be needed long term to effectively treat chronic ocular surface inflammation.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tOmega 3 and topical steroids have also been used for control of inflammation.\n\n\nComputer eye glasses: Studies show that it is effective to reduce evaporation rate by providing a physical barrier to air currents, evaporation, and an increased relative humidity via an enclosed environment with glasses. Isolation techniques with swim or workshop goggles or modified spectacles surrounding the eye decrease entry of particulate matter and prevent desiccation.\n\n\n\tOccasional computer viewers may be able to get away with using their general eyewear, but those who spend several hours a day, may benefit from the use of micro-environment glasses (MEGS). MEGS, unlike swim goggles, can be optically modified and still create an increase in humidified microenvironment that successfully reduces dry eye symptoms and signs as well as symptoms in symptomatic computer users.\n\n\tPresbyopes need the right format of eyewear. Conventional bifocals are designed for viewing at 16 inches at an angle of 20\u02da below primary gaze. Computer screens are usually 24 inches away and only slightly below primary gaze. Occupational progressive lenses are now available, which incorporate a large area in the top half of the lens for mid-distance viewing (i.e. VDT) and a bottom half of the lens for near distance (i.e. keyboard and desktop). Some lenses even contain a small area for distance viewing, usually at the top of the lens.\n\n\nPartial or complete punctal occlusion: Partial or complete punctal occlusion may be resorted to restore aqueous deficiencies.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.

World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child\u2019s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power. Child maltreatment can be distinguished in to:\n\nPhysical abuse, that is intentional use of physical force against a child such as inflicting physical injury by hitting, beating, shaking, biting, scalding, burning, kicking, poisoning and suffocating.\n\nSexual abuse involves engaging a child in sexual acts. It includes fondling, rape, and exposing a child to other sexual activities.\n\nEmotional and psychological abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child\u2019s self-worth or emotional well-being such as name calling, shaming, rejection, withholding love, and threatening.\n\nNeglect is the failure to meet a child\u2019s basic needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, and access to medical care.\n\n\tChild maltreatment is a global problem with serious life-long consequences. International studies reveal that 20% of women and 5\u201310% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25\u201350% of all children report being physically abused. Additionally, many children are subject to emotional abuse (sometimes referred to as psychological abuse) and to neglect.

There may also be associated choroidal rupture or retinal haemorrhage. Following acute episode of oedema, retina may develop scarring and pigment dispersal. Macular commotio retinae reduces central vision. The vision usually improves on resolution of oedema, unless there is development of macular hole or disruption of retinal pigment epithelium of the fovea.\n\n\tStudies suggest that commotio retinae is probably caused due to disruption of the photoreceptor outer segments, and is not a true extracellular oedema.\n\n\tThis is more common in young males.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon the history of injury to the eye and clinical features.\n\n\tThere are two variations of commotio retinae depending upon the severity of injury to the eye.\n\n\nRetinal concussion: Retinal concussion is a mild injury with less dramatic grey-white retinal changes and is less frequently associated with retinal haemorrhage. The retina usually recovers spontaneously without leading to permanent loss of vision.\n\nRetinal contusion: Retinal contusion is produced due to more severe trauma to the eye. It causes more dramatic retinal whitening and haemorrhage. It may lead to permanent loss of vision, especially with involvement of macula.\n\n\nClinical features on examination may include:\n\n\n\t\tRetinal whitening in macular area or retinal periphery\n\n\t\t\u2018Cherry red\u2019 spot at the macula\n\n\t\tRetinal haemorrhage\n\n\t\tChoroidal haemorrhage\n\n\t\tChronic alterations in foveal retinal pigment epithelium\n\n\t\tMacular hole\n\n\t\tRetinal dialysis\n\n\t\tAvulsion of vitreous base\n\n\t\tVitreous haemorrhage\n\n\n\tCommotio retinae is a self-limiting opacification of retina following direct ocular trauma, and is characterised by transient whitening at the level of deep sensory retina.

 {"id":76, "name":"Distichiasis", "intro":"Cavities commonly called as \u201cTooth decay\u201d is damage to the outer protective layer of the tooth i.e. enamel.\n\n\tIt is the most prevalent chronic disease in both children and adults. Tooth Decay (Dental caries) happens when bacteria in mouth make acid that attacks the enamel. It can lead to cavities, which are holes in the teeth. If it is not treated well in time, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss.\n\n\tIn most developing low-income countries, the prevalence rate of dental caries is high and more than 90% of caries is untreated. An estimated 5 billion people worldwide suffer from dental caries.\n\nHOW DO CAVITIES OCCUR?\n\n\tTooth surfaces are rough, uneven and a favourite place for cavity-causing bacteria to hide and\u00a0where leftover food also gets accumulated. These bacteria combine with food and constantly form a soft, sticky film called plaque. When we eat or drink foods containing sugars, the bacteria in plaque produce acid that attacks the tooth enamel. Due to stickiness of the plaque this acid remains in contact with our teeth and over time damages tooth enamel and causes cavities.\n\n\tThe development of caries requires sugars and bacteria to be present. It is influenced by the susceptibility of the tooth, the bacterial profile, quantity and quality of the saliva, low levels of fluoride, and the time for which dietary carbohydrates are available in the oral cavity for bacterial fermentation (i.e. the frequency of sugar intake).\n\n\tSalvia and fluorides, helps the enamel to repair itself by replacing the minerals. Teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if we don't take care of our teeth and/or eat and drink lot of sugary things, enamel will keep losing minerals leading to tooth decay.", "symtoms":"In the beginning, there may not be any symptom at all.

People at higher risk of tooth decay are those who:\n\n\n\t\tdrink from bottles (babies and toddlers), especially if they are given feeders with sugar mixed milk or juices at bedtime. This exposes their teeth to sugars for long periods of time. Their gum pads should be cleaned with a neat cotton cloth after feeding.\n\n\t\tDon't get enough fluorides.\n\n\t\tHave reduced saliva because of some drugs, certain diseases, or some cancer treatment.\n\n\n\t3. Back teeth (molars and premolars) have uneven surface that can trap food particles and are more prone to decay.\u00a0\n\n\t4. Sticky foods such as toffees, chocolates, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips increase chances of tooth decay.\n\n\t5.

 {"id":77, "name":"Double Elevator Palsy", "intro":"INTRODUCTION\n\n\tCleft Lip and Cleft Palate are common congenital malformations (birth defects), also known as oral clefts or orofacial clefts. Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth and they change the shape or function of one or more body parts. During the development of lip and palate in early pregnancy period, incomplete fusion of upper lip and palate leads to the formation of cleft lip and palate in a child.\n\n\tA child can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate or both because development of lips and palate occur at different times during gestation. Children with these birth defects have difficulty in feeding and talking. They are also prone to ear infections, hearing loss, and dental problems.\n\n\tCleft lip and cleft palate are common birth defects and happen very early in the pregnancy. Asian population have highest frequency, often 1 in 500 or higher. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is more common in males than in females. Isolated cleft palate is more common in females whereas males have more severe defects.\n\nCleft lip is an opening in the upper lip due to incomplete formation of the upper lip before birth. It may be unilateral or bilateral (on both sides of lip).\n\nCleft palate is an opening of the hard palate or soft palate (roof of the mouth) due to its incomplete fusion.

Onset is usually slow and gradual, though it is sudden in vascular dementia. There is a progressive deterioration of various intellectual abilities. Often the family members observe that the patient starts forgetting about his daily use belongings, such as purse, pen or shoes and about recent events and whom he met the day before. He forgets about conversations, events of the day, telephone numbers, etc. A distinguishing feature is that the person himself is often not aware of this development.\u00a0 Interestingly, memory for remote events even going back to his early life is preserved.\n\n\tIn later stages, he may even forget names of close relatives, their occupations and places of stay. The patient may even have difficulty recalling the names of grandchildren. The progressive memory impairment may lead to faulty orientation to time and place. Symptoms often worsen at night. Ability to learn new tasks and skills gets impaired. In later stages, judgment also gets affected.\n\n\tIn the early phases, the patient may feel anxious and concerned over the memory disturbance, and may also feel depressed. But as the disturbance increases, the person does not accept memory loss. Sometimes it may progress on to suspiciousness. The patient may become impulsive and socially disinhibited. He may cut coarse jokes without caring for the consequences. In later stages, the patient may be unable to take care of his personal needs, may become sleepless and\u00a0 restless. He may get lost in surroundings familiar to him. In later stages, person may not even be able to take care of basic personal needs and need \u00a0supervised care.\n\n\tFocal neurological deficits like fits, weakness of limbs or body, aphasia or dysarthria and failing vision may appear in later stages of dementia.\n\n\tBehavioural and psychological symptoms like apathy, depression, irritability, agitation/aggression are also common in subjects with dementia. Some patients may also develop paranoid symptoms and disorganized behaviour in later stages of illness.\n\n\tThus dementia often starts off with just memory problems, but later involves:\n\n\n\t\tDifficulty communicating (recognizing, identifying, naming, finding words to explain)\n\n\t\tDifficulty planning and carrying out day-to-day tasks (using household appliances like microwave or washing machine, leaving the gas stove on after cooking, etc)\n\n\t\tAbility to learn, reason, retain or recall past experience\n\n\t\tChanges in mood, personality and judgement\n\n\n\tDementia is differentiated from delirium, which is an acute illness characterized by altered sensorium or decreased level of\u00a0 consciousness, disorientation for time and place, fluctuating course with worsening in evening.\u00a0 Perceptual disturbances like illusions and hallucinations are characteristic features of delirium. Delirium is a medical emergency and is usually short lasting unlike dementia.\n\nReference:\u00a0www.nhs.uk", "causes":"Dementia is a result of degenerative changes in the brain. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. One study from India analyzing types of dementia found Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 38.3%, vascular dementia in 25.4%, fronto-temporal dementia in 18.7%, diffuse Lewy body disease in 8.9%, and mixed dementia in 8.6% of the patients. In dementia, the brain cells tend to degenerate and die more rapidly than the normal ageing process.\n\tSome of the important characteristics of these different types of dementia are discussed as below:\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease: Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia, contributing to about 40% cases of dementia in India. Loss of memory for recent events is initial manifestation, worsening slowly over time and involving other cognitive functions. \u00a0Though there is difficulty in remembering the events that have happened recently, the patient is able to recall the events of remote past. The patient has also difficulty in recalling particular words and naming objects.\n\tFamily members would give history of the patient having:\n\n\n\t\tDifficulty in learning new things.\n\n\t\tDifficulty remembering appointments or phone messages.\n\n\t\tInability to remember the names of people or places and difficulty communicating with others.\n\n\t\tForgetting where they have put things of daily use like watch, purse, etc. The patient may also worry that someone has taken away.\n\n\t\tDenial of the memory problem, The person may attempt to cover up the deficit.\n\n\n\tCause lies in degenerative changes in the brain. The damaged tissue in brain builds up to \u00a0form deposits called 'plaques' and 'tangles'. These cause brain cells around them to die.\n\nVascular dementia: Vascular dementia, also called multi infarct dementia, is the second commonest cause of dementia. Compared to the West, it is more common in India. It is usually caused by blockage in the blood vessels supplying the brain, leading to ischemia or infarct. MRI of brain would reveal multiple infarcts. Sometime vascular dementia develops after an attack of stroke.\u00a0 Memory disturbances come in form of step ladder pattern, increasing with a fresh infarct. \u00a0Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or high cholesterol.\n\tSome of the important characteristics of vascular dementia are:\n\n\n\t\tMemory loss and difficulty concentrating.\n\n\t\tLanguage problems like aphasia\n\n\t\tMood swings, depression\u00a0\n\n\t\tEpisodes of confusion, aggressive behaviour, hallucinations\n\n\t\tPhysical deficits like paralysis or weakness of limbs\n\n\n\tBoth vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease can also co-exist.\n\nLewy body dementia: Lewy body dementia is a relatively less common type of dementia, compared to the Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia. It is characterized by development of protein deposits (Lewy bodies) building up in the brain. Some of the symptoms overlap with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\tCharacteristic features of Lewy body dementia are\n\n\n\t\tFluctuating level of attention and alertness\n\n\t\tVivid visual hallucinations (seeing human or animal figures)\n\n\t\tTrembling of hands, muscle stiffness, falls or difficulty with walking.\n\n\nFronto-temporal dementia: In fronto- temporal dementia, the front part of the brain consisting of frontal and temporal lobes is predominantly involved. It is slightly more common than Lewy body dementia. \u00a0It is seen in relatively younger people compared to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia, usually starting in 50s and 60s.\u00a0 Personality deterioration, social disinhibition, \u00a0and behavioural disorganization\u00a0 are common.

The person needs to be examined in detail to rule out dementia.\u00a0 Mini Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) or its Hindi adaptation called Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE) are commonly used to screen for dementia. Both can be administered in a clinic setting and take about 10 minutes.\n\tDetailed physical and neurological examination is conducted. The person needs to be investigated \u00a0for basic haematology, liver function, kidney function, thyroid, nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin B12 and folate. Sometimes, nutritional deficiencies or hypothyroidism may be responsible for the dementing changes. Once corrected, the memory disturbance improves. Similarly chronic alcohol use can also lead to dementia.\n\tA CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) are also performed to detect the degenerative changes. Diagnosis of dementia is, however, mainly clinical.", "management":"Dementia, being a degenerative illness, is mostly untreatable. Investigations are generally performed to find out a treatable cause, which if identified (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiency ), can be corrected. Certain measures like good nutrition, regular exercise and adequate sleep can improve the quality of life of the patient, and also help in slowing the progression of disease. Simplifying activities or modifying expectations to the cognitive and skill level of the patient can eliminate frustration. The home environment may need to be modified (lighting, positioning of bed, toilets, etc) to compensate for the patient's deficits.\n\tThe family members caring for the patient with dementia also face tremendous stress and burden in the care giving role and also need psychological support, guidance and help. They need to be educated about the problem and guided how to deal with it. Family therapy, group therapy and counselling are used to help them. Some of the NGOs like HelpAge India also run self \u00a0help groups.\n\tCertain medications like donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine (also called cholinesterase inhibitors) are useful in early stages of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and slow down the progress of dementia.

Its complications are:\n\nAcute:\n\n\nDiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): It is an intense and dangerous complication that can always result in a medical emergency. It is generally seen due to low insulin levels which may cause the liver to turn fatty acid to ketone for fuel as ketone bodies are intermediate substrates in that metabolic sequence. This is a normal condition if occurs periodically, but can become a serious problem if sustained. Elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood decrease the blood's pH leading to DKA. The patient with DKA is typically dehydrated and breathing rapidly and deeply. Abdominal pain is common and may be severe.\n\nHyperglycemia: Hyperglycemia is another acute complication. If a person has very high (usually considered to be above 300 mg/dl (16 mmol/L)) blood glucose levels, water is osmotically drawn out of cells into the blood and the kidneys eventually begin to dump glucose into the urine. This results in loss of water and an increase in blood osmolarity. If fluid is not replaced (by mouth or intravenously) the osmotic effect of high glucose levels combined with the loss of water will eventually lead to dehydration. The body's cells become progressively dehydrated as water is taken from them and excreted. Electrolyte imbalances are also common and can be very dangerous.\n\nHypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia or abnormally low blood glucose is an acute complication of several diabetes treatments. It is rare otherwise, either in diabetic or non-diabetic patients. The patient may become agitated, sweaty, weak, and have many symptoms of sympathetic activation of the autonomic nervous system resulting in feelings akin to dread and immobilized panic.\n\nDiabetic Coma: Diabetic coma is a medical emergency in which a person with diabetes mellitus is unconscious as of one of the acute complications of diabetes:\n\n\n\n\t\tSevere diabetic hypoglycemia\n\n\t\tDiabetic ketoacidosis advanced enough to result in unconsciousness from a combination of severe hyperglycemia, dehydration and shock and exhaustion\n\n\t\tHyperosmolar nonketotic coma in which extreme hyperglycemia and dehydration alone are sufficient to cause unconsciousness.\n\n\nChronic:\n\n(a)Micro vascular diseases (due to damage to small blood vessels):\n\n\t1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eye Diseases:\n\n\n\t\tRetinopathy (nonproliferative/proliferative)\n\n\t\tMacular oedema\n\n\n\tThese conditions can lead to serious vision loss or blindness.\n\n\t2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neuropathy:\n\n\n\t\tSensory and motor(mono-and polyneuoropathy) neuropathy: sensory symptoms such as\u00a0 tingling , burning, stabbing pain or other abnormal sensations and motor symptoms such as sensory loss, weakness, numbness starting from feet and later on can involve finger and arm.\n\n\t\tAutonomic neuropathy affects the digestive system, blood vessels, urinary system as well as sex organs.\n\n\n\t3. \u00a0 \u00a0 Nephropathy: Damage to kidney can lead to chronic renal failure.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n(b) Macro vascular diseases:\n\n\n\t\tCoronary artery\u00a0 disease\n\n\t\tPeripheral arterial disease\n\n\t\tCerebrovascular disease\n\n\n(c) Other diseases:\n\n\n\t\tHigh blood sugar level in blood can lead to cataract, glaucoma.\n\n\t\tDermatological complications- bacterial infections, fungal infections and some other skin conditions are more common in diabetic persons.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Infectious diseases are more frequent and/or serious in patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\n\t\tPeriodontal Disease-When diabetes is not controlled properly high glucose levels in\u00a0mouth\u00a0fluids may help germs to develop and cause periodontal diseases.\n\n\t\tCheiroarthropathy is a condition of limited joint mobility in patients with diabetes and is characterized by thickening of the skin resulting in contracture of the fingers.\n\n\t\tDiabetic dyslipidemia: The characteristic features are a high plasma triglyceride concentration, low high density liprotein (HDL) concentration and increased concentration of low density lipoproteins (LDL).\n\n\nReference:\u00a0www.diabetes.co.uk\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 *Diabetic & Metabolic Syndrome: clinical research & review 4(2010) 10-12", "Prevention":"There is no vaccine to prevent dengue yet.

Items that collect rainwater or are used to store water (for example, plastic containers, drums, buckets, or used automobile tires) should be cleaned or discarded. Pet watering containers and flower vases should be emptied and scrub dried at least once a week.

 {"id":85, "name":"Epicanthus", "intro":"Diabetes mellitus is caused due to lack or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin and is characterised by hyperglycaemia.\n\n\tThere are two broad types:\n\n\tType I: This is known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is characterised by insulin deficiency. Usually it has juvenile onset but may occur at any age. Patients are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss.\n\n\tType II: This is known as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity onset diabetes mellitus. It occurs in middle aged/ older people who are often obese. There is impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. Patients may be managed with oral hypoglycaemic agents (drugs which lower blood sugar level). Patients may eventually need insulin especially those with ketonuria or dehydration. This does not mean that IDDM has developed.\n\n\tDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by changes in retinal blood vessels that occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. DR is a retinal microangiopathy affecting arterioles, capillaries and the venules. However, larger vessels may be involved as well.\n\n\tCentral retina or macular area is located between main superior and inferior retinal artery and vein. The area beyond these main vessels is the peripheral retina.\n\n\tRetinopathy has features of both micro-vascular occlusion and micro-vascular leakage of plasma constituents due to breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Micro-vascular occlusion leads to arteriovenous shunts with capillary blockage and neovascularisation (new vessel formation). Micro-vascular leakage may cause haemorrhage and diffuse or localised retinal oedema. This disease can affect vision.\n\n\tDiabetic retinopathy is broadly divided as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Background Diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1225122-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117853-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117739-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Diabetic_Retinopathy\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896358\n\n\tKanski,Jack J.

These may be absorbed over a period of time.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal oedema: Retinal oedema is characterised by retinal thickening which obscures underlying layers of retina. Fovea (point of retina through which an object is seen) may assume cystoid appearance due to progressive retinal oedema. Retinal oedema may present as \u2018macular oedema\u2019 or as \u2018clinically significant macular oedema\u2019.\n\n\tMacular oedema: Macular oedema is the presence of retinal thickening or hard exudates within one disc diameter (disc is the point of exit of optic nerve and is 1500\u00b5m in size) of the center of fovea.\n\n\tClinically significant macular oedema (CSMO): This is characterised by the presence of one or more of the following features.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal oedema within 500\u00b5m of the center of fovea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hard exudates within 500\u00b5m of the fovea, associated with adjacent retinal thickening, which may be outside the limit of 500\u00b5m.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal oedema of one disc diameter or larger, any part of which is within one disc diameter of the center of fovea.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tFeatures of Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Retinal changes in Pre-proliferative DR are produced due to ischaemia and consists of:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vascular appearance: Venules show beading, looping or sausage like segmentation.

Over one-quarter of the retina has to be non-perfused before NVD develops. Later, there may be formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in the potential vitreoretinal space.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vitreous detachment or separation: Formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in potential vitreoretinal space may lead to total or partial posterior vitreous detachment. The fibro-vascular tissue may become adherent to posterior vitreous face. Pull on fibro-vascular tissue by the vitreous detachment may lead to haemorrhage in vitreoretinal space or within the vitreous. PDR is asymptomatic until the onset of vitreous haemorrhage.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Haemorrhage: Haemorrhage may occur in potential vitreoretinal space (retrohyaloid space) as pre-retinal haemorrhage or into the vitreous gel (intravitreal haemorrhage).Intravitreal (Intra-gel) haemorrhage takes longer to clear as compared to pre-retinal haemorrhage. Pre-retinal haemorrhage takes crescentic shape along the posterior vitreous detachment.\n\n\tComplications of Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: PDR may lead to retinal detachment, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, rubeosis iridis (formation of new vessels on iris) or formation of opaque membrane on posterior surface of detached vitreous.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tLaboratory tests for Diabetic Retinopathy:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye. Fluorescein Angiography helps in assessing degree of retinal ischaemia and delineates retinal vascular abnormalities. Microaneurysms appear as hyper-fluorescent spots which leaks the dye in late phases of FA. \u2018Blot\u2019 and \u2018Dot\u2019 haemorrhages appear hypo-fluorescent in contrast to micro-aneurysms. Nonperfused areas appear as dark patches or homogeneous hypo-fluorescent areas. NVD and NVE also show leakage of dye on FA. Intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormalities do not leak dye.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT generates cross-sectional image of the retina with light.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis) are VEGF antibodies and antibody fragments (Anti-VEGF) respectively, being used \u00a0as intravitreal injection. Intravitreal Aflibercept (Eylea) may also be given to patients with diabetic macular oedema.\n\nLaser Photocoagulation for Diabetic retinopathy:\n\n\tLaser photocoagulation is a non-invasive technique that has relatively low rate of complication and a significant success rate.

One type of diphtheria affects the throat and sometimes the tonsils. Another type causes ulcers on the skin; these are more common in the tropics (places where all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18\u00a0\u00b0C). Diphtheria particularly affects the children aged 1 to 5 years of age. In temperate climates (have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring) diphtheria tends to occur during the colder months.\n\n\tVaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically; however diphtheria is still a significant child health problem in countries with poor coverage of Expanded programme on immunization (EPI).

Disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations.\n\n\tDisability is not just a health problem; it is the interaction between individuals with a health condition and personal and environmental factors (such as negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports). Overcoming the difficulties faced by people with disabilities requires interventions to remove environmental and social barriers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tOver 1 billion people, about 15% of the world's population have some form of disability. Of this number 110 million to 190 million people of 15 years and older have significant difficulties in functioning and 93 million people less than 15 years of age live with a moderate or severe disability.\n\n\tIn India according to the Census 2011, 2.2% of population had some form of disability. The prevalence of disability was found to be more in rural areas (2.24%) as compared to urban areas (2.17%) and more among males (2.4%) than among females (2%). The proportion of\u00a0 different types of disability among people with disability reported as: (i) seeing 18.8%, (ii) hearing 18.9% (iii) speech 7.5% (iv) movement 20.3% (v) mental retardation 7.6% (vi) mental illness 2.7%, (vii) multiple disabilities 7.9% (viii) Any other 18.4%.\n\n\tIn the coming years, prevalence of disability will continue to increase due to increase in ageing populations and with the global increase in chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders, injuries, car crashes, falls, violence. \u00a0\n\n\tAll people with disabilities have the same general health care needs as everyone else; however they have greater unmet health care needs than people without disabilities. Evidence suggests that people with disabilities face barriers in accessing the health and rehabilitation services they need in many settings. According to World Health organization (WHO) estimates:\n\n\n\t\t200 million people need glasses or other low vision devices and do not have access to them.\n\n\t\t70 million people need a wheelchair, only 5-15% have access to one.\n\n\t\t360million people globally have moderate to profound hearing loss and only 10% of global needs of hearing aids are met.\n\n\t\tHalf of the people with disabilities cannot afford health care.\n\n\n\tPeople with disabilities have generally poorer health, lower education levels, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disability. This is due to many obstacles they face in their everyday life and due to lack of services available to them.\u00a0\n\n\tDisability is now understood to be a human rights issue. People are disabled by society, not just by their bodies. These barriers can be overcome, if governments, nongovernmental organizations, professionals and people with disabilities and their families work together.\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/199544/1/9789241509619_\n\nwww.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/\n\nwww.mospi.gov.in/publication/disability-india-statistical-profile-2011\n\nwww.who.int/disabilities/facts/Infographic_\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs352/en/\n\nwww.who.int/features/factfiles/disability/en/\n\nwww.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/en/", "symtoms":"General symptoms for a disabled person according to type of disability-\n\n\ti.

 {"id":91, "name":"Eclampsia", "intro":"Dermatochalasis is a term that is defined as excess upper and/or lower eyelid skin. The eyelid skin is thin and prone to fine wrinkling. Redundant skin is often associated with fat herniation, descent of eyebrows, and descent of mid-face. Fat herniation is most common in the superomedial region and in the inferomedial and central part. In addition, variable puffiness due to eyelid oedema and discolouration from venous leakage (black circles under eyes) develop with age. It is a common condition and is seen in elderly persons, but occasionally in young adults also.

It includes health promotion measures designed to promote general health and well being and quality of life of the people; and specific protection by specific protective measures such as polio vaccination, intake of iodized salt. The concept is also now being applied to the prevention of chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, hypertension and cancer), based on elimination or modification of risk factors of the disease such as prevention of harmful lifestyle including eating pattern, lack of physical exercise, smoking.\n\nSecondary prevention is the actions to detect a health problem at an early stage in an individual or a population, facilitating cure, or reducing or preventing spread, or reducing or preventing its long-term effects (for example, supporting women with intellectual disability to access breast cancer screening). In order to achieve it, proper diagnostic and treatment facilities should be uniformly available at all levels of health care.\n\nTertiary prevention includes actions to reduce the impact of an already established disease by restoring function and reducing disease related complications. When long term functional limitation has developed, measures instituted should aim at prevention of disability. Such measures should include medical and psycho-social care, with educational and vocational training. The environment may be changed to improve health conditions, prevent impairments, and improve outcomes for persons with disabilities such as accessible design of the built environment and transport, more opportunities for work and employment for persons with disabilities.\n\nMinistry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE), Government of India has formulated several acts/legislations and rules/regulations* for providing support to people with diability (PwD).

This disorder may be familial in origin with an autosomal dominant inheritance, but may also be produced by acquired conditions such as severe inflammation or trauma. It is presumed to be due to differentiation of primary epithelial germ cells originally destined for development of meibomian or tarsal glands. Meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located in the tarsal plate of eyelids. In skin, pilo-sebaceous unit consists of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicle and sweat gland. It is believed that meibomian gland may undergo differentiation into primitive pilo-sebaceous unit which produces distichiasis.\n\n\tThe roots of eyelashes (cilias) lie against the anterior surface of the tarsal plate. The cilia come out of skin at the anterior lid margin and curve away from the globe. The lid margin from anterior to posterior comprises of\n\n\n\t\tEyelashes.\n\n\t\tGrey line (border between anterior (lash, skin and orbicularis oculi muscle) and posterior (tarsal plate and conjunctiva) lamella.\n\n\t\tMeibomian gland orifices.\n\n\t\tMucocutaneous junction.\n\n\t\tConjunctiva.\n\n\n\tDistichiasis may present only a few isolated eyelashes, or as a complete accessory second row of lashes.

Lymphoedema may present after the age of ten years and may not be noticeable at the time of presentation of distichiasis. Associated abnormalities include entropion, ptosis, cleft lip and palate, webbed neck, vertebral anomalies, and congenital heart defects. Isolated congenital distichiasis is extremely rare.\n\nAcquired distichiasis: Acquired distichiasis is more common than the congenital form. It is seen more often with chronic inflammatory conditions such as blepharitis, staphylococcal hypersensitivity, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), chemical injuries to the eyes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon slit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist.\n\nCongenital distichiasis: Examination shows eyelashes exiting posterior to the normal row of lashes. These lashes emerge at or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. The aberrant lashes tend to be thinner and shorter than the normal lashes and are often directed posteriorly. These cilia are usually well tolerated during infancy and may not be symptomatic until five years of age.\n\nAcquired distichiasis: Since it is caused by metaplasia of the meibomian glands into hair follicles, variable number of lashes grows from meibomian gland openings. In contrast to congenital distichiasis, the lashes tend to be non-pigmented and stunted, and are usually symptomatic.\n\n\tDistichiasis may be associated with signs of conjunctival redness and chemosis, epithelial breakdown of cornea, corneal scarring or pannus formation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis of distichiasis includes conditions like\n\n\nTrichiasis: Trichiasis is a condition in which eyelashes from the normal anterior margin are misdirected towards the eye.\n\nEntropion: Entropion is a condition in which the entire eyelid margin turns inward.\n\nEpiblepharon: Epiblepharon is a condition which is seen mostly in children.

Cryoprobe freezes the lash follicles and destroys it. Since this approach is non-selective, it may permanently damage the normal anterior eyelashes leading to madarosis (loss of eyelashes). It should be avoided in cases with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.\n\nLaser thermoablation: Laser thermoablation may be used to destroy eyelash follicles.\n\nRadiofrequency ablation: Smallest gauge wire is introduced alongside the lash to the follicle for destruction with radiofrequency.\n\nLid splitting procedure: This involves an incision in eyelid margin immediately anterior to the distichiatic cilia.

 {"id":93, "name":"Filariasis", "intro":"Double Elevator Palsy refers to limited elevation of one eye in adduction, primary gaze, and abduction. The term double elevator refers to both the elevators of an eye i.e. superior rectus and inferior oblique muscle. However, there are cases in which deficient elevation is produced by tight inferior rectus muscle. Due to this, Double elevator palsy is included under restrictive strabismus. Now Double elevator palsy is known by a more descriptive term as Monocular Elevation Deficit Syndrome (MED).This is distinguished from Brown\u2019s syndrome in which elevation is restricted much more in adduction rather than in abduction.\n\n\tThis condition presents as hypotropia when the patient fixates with normal non-paretic eye. Chin elevation and ptosis/pseudoptosis are often present. Fixation with the paretic eye produces hypertropia of the normal non-paretic eye. Ptosis also disappears since it is not due to paresis of levator palpebrae superioris muscle.\n\nWhite (1942) described a congenital deficiency of upgaze associated with hypotropia and ptosis of the affected paretic eye. Dunlap (1952) to describe the weakness affecting both elevators of involved eye coined the term Double elevator palsy.\n\n\tDouble elevator palsy may be associated with certain innervational conditions such as\n\n\n\t\tJaw-winking ptosis\n\n\t\tDuane\u2019s retraction syndrome\n\n\t\tOther misdirection strabismus syndromes\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nWright Kenneth W.

Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) may be present. Upward and outward rolling of eyeballs or Bell\u2019s phenomenon is often preserved.\n\n\tSince elevation is preserved in Bell\u2019s phenomenon, DVD or under anaesthesia, several authors believe it to be a supranuclear disorder. Others discuss it to be a fascicular lesion. Long lasting palsy of superior rectus alone may impede elevation in adduction, thus nuclear origin of superior rectus may be a factor. Even primary fibrotic origin is presumed in cases showing resistance to forced duction test.\n\n\tThus supranuclear, nuclear, fascicular and muscular causes are discussed for double elevator palsy.\n\n\tCerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension, thromboembolism, and arteritis usually cause acquired cases.

The presence of associated amblyopia points to congenital aetiology.\n\n\tIn acquired MED, history of associated neurological features (ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, loss of consciousness) is important. History of malignancy or cardiovascular disorder is also important.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClinical examination\n\n\tClinical examination distinguishes between MED due to primary superior rectus palsy, any cause of supranuclear superior rectus weakness, or primary/secondary inferior rectus restriction.\n\nPrimary superior rectus palsy or paresis: It is characterised by a forced duction test showing no restriction to full upward rotation. Bell\u2019s phenomenon is not present.\n\nSupranuclear superior rectus weakness: This is usually congenital and is characterised by monocular absence of vertical eye movements in superior field of gaze. There is no resistance to upward gaze in forced duction test. Bell\u2019s phenomenon is present.\n\nPatients with primary inferior rectus restriction or fibrosis: This group of patients often do not have hypotropia in primary gaze. Forced duction test shows restriction to upward rotation because of inferior rectus restriction. Superior rectus palsy or supranuclear disorders may produce secondary contracture in inferior rectus. Hypotropia and ptosis are usually present. Forced duction test shows inferior rectus restriction.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nCongenital MED\n\n\nEyes: Classically MED present with unilateral limitation of upgaze above horizontal midline with accompanying ptosis. Limitation in upgaze is same whether in adduction or abduction. The affected eye is hypotropic. Ptosis is most noticeable when the nonparetic eye fixes and the paretic eye is hypotropic. Pseudoptosis occurs when the eyelid is passively drawn down in hypotropic eye. It resolves when paretic eye takes up fixation. True ptosis does not resolve when paretic eye takes up fixation. In cases with associated ptosis and pseudoptosis together, ptosis improves in part when the paretic eye takes up fixation in primary position.\n\nHead posture: Depending upon degree of binocularity and fixation preference, variable head postures are observed in MED. A patient with hypotropia and having some degree of fusion, usually tilts head back in chin up position to maintain binocularity. Cases with no hypotropia or hypotropic eye is also amblyopic, adopts a normal head posture.

Epilepsy is caused when there are disruptions to the normal connections between nerve cells in the brain (much like disruptions in wiring of a complex electrical circuit), when there are imbalances of natural chemicals or neurotransmitters that are important to the signaling among nerve cells, or when there are changes in the membranes of nerve cells, including proteins called ion channels, that alter their normal sensitivity.p\n\n\tSome of these disruptions, imbalances, and changes may develop early in life, sometimes related to early exposures and events and sometimes related to hereditary factors.\n\n\tThere are three main categories of epilepsy:\n\nMetabolic/ structural epilepsy There is a known cause for a person\u2019s epilepsy, such as a head injury, infections, birth hypoxia etc.\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy \u2013 No apparent cause for epilepsy can be found despite investigations.\n\nEpilepsy due to unknown cause like idiopathic epilepsy, no apparent cause can be found. However, there is strong evidence that this type of epilepsy may be the result of brain damage.

Rarely \u00a0certain epilepsy syndromes require particular triggers for seizures to occur. These are termed reflex epilepsy. For example, patients with primary reading epilepsy have seizures triggered by reading Photosensitive epilepsy can be limited to seizures triggered by flashing lights.\n\nDiagnostic methods:\n\n\tMagnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI): An MRI scan can often detect possible causes of epilepsy, such as defects in the structure of your brain or the presence of a brain tumor. For epilepsy, an epilepsy protocol MRI should be done. This test is not painful.\n\n\tElectroencephalograph (EEG): An EEG test measures the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. During the test, patient may be asked to breathe deeply or close the eyes, as these actions could reveal unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. Patient might also be asked to look at a flashing light, but the test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.This test is not painful.\n\n\tYour diagnosis may vary so it is advisable to consult your physician for further diagnosis.\n\nReferences:\u00a0\n\n\nwww.nhs.uk\n\nwww.epilepsyindia.org\n\nwww.epilepsyfoundationindia.com", "management":"Epilepsy is usually treated with medication prescribed by a physician; primary caregivers,\u00a0neurologists, and neurosurgeons \u00a0all frequently care for people with epilepsy.

 {"id":101, "name":"Fibromyalgia", "intro":"Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis caused by a group of viruses known as adenoviruses. Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37 are often associated with EKC. Family of adenoviruses contain different serotypes that can also cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. In addition to infections of ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, adenovirus (mainly those responsible for paryngoconjunctival fever) is responsible for causing infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. EKC is reported worldwide and has a tendency to occur in epidemics.\n\n\tMore than half of cases may show symptoms, though milder, in other eye.\n\n\tIt is one of the most common causes of acute conjunctivitis, with clinical features such as sudden onset of acute follicular conjunctivitis, watering of eyes, chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), redness and ipsilateral (same side) pre-auricular (in front of ear) lymphadenopathy.\n\n\tDevelopment of keratitis (corneal inflammation) distinguishes EKC from other forms of conjunctivitis and it usually arises after fourth day of initial onset of symptoms. Corneal involvement ranges from diffuse, fine superficial keratitis to epithelial defects to sub-epithelial infiltrates. Sub-epithelial infiltrates can persist for years, which may cause glare and reduction in visual acuity.\n\n\tEpidemic kerato-conjunctivitis may also develop membranous or pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis in severe cases, which may lead to scarring of conjunctiva and symblepharon (adhesion between eyelid and eyeball) formation.\n\n\tEKC is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. Diagnosis of the disease process is clinical and the treatment is mostly symptomatic. Antiviral and cyclosporine eye drops were tried in some patients, but there was no definite benefit of these. Mild topical steroids may be used in cases with severe membranous conjunctivitis. Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin C (MMC), may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1192751-overview\n\nhttp://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/21109229\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661494/\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1191370-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Epidemic_Keratoconjunctivitis\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Conjunctivitis\n\nhttp://eyetubeod.com/advancedocularcare/pdfs/aoc1112_cornea_Starr.pdf\n\nHeidelbaugh Joel J, Primary care: Clinics in Office Practice Vol.42, Number 3, September, 2015.

Most frequent site for epibulbar dermoid is inferior-temporal part of limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva). Occasionally, dermoid may be present entirely within cornea or may be localised to conjunctiva. Choristomas consist of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues in varying proportion and may contain epidermal appendages, skin, sweat gland, connective tissue, muscle, tooth, fat, lacrimal gland, bone, cartilage, vascular or neurologic tissue.\n\n\tThere are three broad categories of dermoids depending upon the location:\n\n\t\u00a0Limbal: Limbal dermoid straddles the limbus and is the most common type. Limbal dermoids are superficial usually, but may affect deeper structures as well.\n\nCorneal: This includes dermoid which involves superficial cornea only. This spares the limbus, descemet membrane and endothelium.\n\nAnterior segment: This group includes dermoid which involves the entire anterior segment.

It occurs as an epidemic (unusual occurrence of \u00a0disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area) form in places where mustard oil \u00a0is commonly used as cooking mediums as in North, North-Western and North- Eastern states of India, generally sparing South Indian states where the predominant cooking oil is coconut oil. In Western Rajasthan, India a small outbreak was reported from consumption of contaminated sesame seeds oil with Argemone Mexicana.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\tEpidemic dropsy was first reported by Lyon in 1877 from Calcutta, India and since then outbreaks/cases were reported from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Rajasthan and Punjab.\n\n\tThe epidemic in\u00a01998 at New Delhi was the large outbreak in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized. Even after that the epidemics occurred at Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005), Panchmahal and Dungarpur (2012) districts of India. Usually, epidemics in India have been reported between July and September, but because of enforcement of law and public awareness the mode of presentation has changed from an epidemic to a sporadic pattern.\n\n\tThe main symptom of epidemic dropsy consists of bilateral swelling of legs often associated with erythema, diarrhea, dyspnoea, glaucoma. Persons of all ages and both sexes were affected except breastfed infants and small children who have no mustard oil in their diets.\n\n\tEpidemic dropsy has been also reported from Fiji Islands, Madagascar, Mauritius and Cape Districts of South Africa. All outbreaks were related to the intake of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil except in the South African epidemic which occurred because of consumption of wheat flour adulterated with argemone seeds.\n\n\tThe Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has made \u201cThe Food Safety and Standards (packaging and labelling) regulations\u201d 2011*, according to this every container of refined vegetable oil should carry the label \u201cfree from Argemone Oil\u201d along with other specifications mentioned under FSSAI.\u00a0\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed\n\nidsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/DOB\n\nnmji.in/archives/Volume-11\n\nwww.ajtmh.org/content/\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles\n\n\t*www.fssai.gov.in\u00a0(Food Safety and Standards (packaging and labelling) Regulations, 2011, 2.4.2: Labelling of edible oils and fats:4(a))", "symtoms":"The disease is mostly reported in epidemic form but sporadic cases were also reported.

Crops of mustard oil are matured during March and at the same time seeds of argemone also mature hence there may be accidental mixing of both seeds. However intentional mixing of Argemone mexicana oil with mustard oil by unscrupulous traders can lead to large scale outbreaks.\n\n\tToxic effects of argemone oil are because of two physiologically active (benzophenanthridine) alkaloids-sanguinarine and dihydro-sanguinarine. Sanguinarine interferes with the oxidation of pyruvic acid that accumulates in the blood.\n\n\tThe outbreaks of epidemic dropsy occur usually in months of May to September in India because newly extracted oil is sold during these months in the market.

The misdirected lashes may be diffuse involving the entire lid (diffuse trichiasis) or may involve a small segment of it (simple trichiasis).\n\nDistichiasis: Distichiasis is characterised by an extra row of eyelashes emanating from the meibomian gland orifices. Like epiblepharon, eyelid margin is in its normal position.\n\nEpicanthus: Epicanthus may result similar appearing fold of skin close to the eyelid margin. An associated semicircular epicanthal fold may contribute to additional medial canthal tension and worsens epiblepharon.\u00a0\n\nCongenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction: If epiphora persists after treatment of epiblepharon, congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction should be considered.\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis: Allergic conjunctivitis may also be considered in cases of chronic bilateral eye irritation, watering, and redness of eyes.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical therapy\n\n\tEpiblepharon may be managed conservatively unless there are issues related to eyelash contact with ocular surface or there are concerns about refractive amblyopia.\n\n\nLubricating artificial tears: Lubricating artificial tears may be used as soothing agents.

 {"id":105, "name":"Glaucoma", "intro":"Epicanthus or epicanthal fold is a semi-lunar fold of skin at medial canthus, with its concavity facing outward. The epicanthal fold obscures the view of the medial canthus including caruncle and plica semilunaris. This is the most common congenital lid condition. Epicanthus may be an isolated phenomenon or it may be an associated feature in patients with congenital ptosis (drooping of eyelids), Down\u2019s syndrome or blepharophimosis (shortening of palpebral fissure both horizontally and vertically) syndrome. This condition may be unilateral or bilateral and is most prominent along the upper lid. Although, it is a normal finding in people of Asian ancestry, but is abnormal in non-Asians.\n\n\tEpicanthus gives rise to the appearance of pseudostrabismus (present as pseudoesotropia). This condition does not pose any problem to the eye. However, it produces parental concern because of its resemblance to pseudoesotropia. Gentle stretch of the soft tissues of the nasal bridge reduces appearance of epicanthus at the medial canthus and reveals normal alignment of the eyes. Cover and cross-cover test reveals orthophoria (normal alignment of eyes).\n\n\tDepending on the origin and configuration of free fold, there are at least four distinct types of epicanthus such as\n\n\n\t\tEpicanthus supraciliaris.\n\n\t\tEpicanthus palpebralis.\n\n\t\tEpicanthus tarsalis.\n\n\t\tEpicanthus inversus.\n\n\n\tEpicanthus generally disappears by the age of puberty as the nasal bridge grows. Epicanthus inversus is usually seen in association with blepharophimosis and may be associated with relative shortage of skin in lateral periorbital area.\n\nEpiblepharon, a related condition seen more frequently in Asians, occurs when a skin fold runs the entire length of the lower eyelid just below the eyelashes, causing them to turn inward, leading to irritation of eyes.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nAgarwal Amar, Jacob Soosan.

 {"id":106, "name":"Goitre", "intro":"Euryblepharon is characterised by increased vertical separation of the temporal aspect of the palpebral fissure so that the palpebral conjunctiva is not in apposition with the eye. The enlargement of palpebral fissure is accompanied by variable degree of lower eyelid ectropion. The lower eyelid ectropion is caused by vertical shortening of the lower eyelid relative to the horizontal dimensions of the opposing upper eyelid. In euryblepharon, palpebral apertures are larger than normal and it may be associated with epicanthus. Widening of palpebral fissure may give the appearance of eyelid ptosis. \u00a0The eyelids are normally developed but the insertions of the canthal tendons appear to be widely or anteriorly placed. Frequently, the palpebral fissure has downward slant as well because of an inferiorly displaced attachment of the lateral canthal tendon.\n\n\tEuryblepharon is present at birth and there is no other associated primary ocular abnormality. In contrast, secondary enlargement of the palpebral aperture may accompany a variety of ocular abnormalities.\n\n\tThis condition was first described by Desmarres (1854). The average length of the lid fissures at different ages is given by Duke-Elder and Cook (1963). It increases from 18.35 mm. at birth to 29.68 mm. at 24 to 26 years of age. One half of this increase occurs in the first 4 years of life. The length is slightly less for females.\n\nReferences\n\nGarg Ashok, Rosen Emanuel, Mortensen Jes, Toukhy Essam El, Dhaliwal Ranjit S.

 {"id":107, "name":"Gaming disorder", "intro":"Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in early pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy\u00a0is defined as implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity. In a normal pregnancy, the fertilized egg moves from the fallopian tube into the uterus, where the pregnancy develops. In a small percentage of pregnancies, however, the embryo implants in extra uterine locations leading to an ectopic pregnancy. Most extra uterine pregnancies (97%) implant in the fallopian tube; another 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant in the cervix, ovary, peritoneal cavity, or in uterine scars. In ectopic pregnancy as the pregnancy continues, it can cause the tube to rupture with internal bleeding. This situation can be life threatening and needs to be treated as medical emergency.\n\n\tMany risk factors like pelvic inflammatory disease, intrauterine device, tubal surgeries, sexually transmitted diseases, infertility are associated with ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\tThe incidence of ectopic pregnancy among all pregnancies is about 0.25-2.0% worldwide* and can occur in any sexually active woman of reproductive age. Ectopic pregnancy was reported in 0.91% of pregnant women (with no maternal deaths) in a study done at tertiary care centre in South India.**\n\n\tGlobally the incidence of ectopic pregnancy has been on the rise over the past few decades because of increased incidence of salpingitis (infection of fallopian tubes mostly due to sexually transmitted infections), induction of ovulation, and tubal surgeries; and improved ability to detect ectopic pregnancy. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy has risen from 4.5 cases per 1,000 pregnancies in 1970 to 19.7 cases per 1,000 pregnancies in 1992 in North America. Though the cases of ectopic pregnancy are on rise; the incidence of rupture of ectopic pregnancy and maternal deaths has declined because of early diagnosis and management. Ectopic pregnancy still accounts for 4% to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths and leads to a high incidence of ectopic site gestations in subsequent pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancy accounts for 3.5-7.1% of maternal deaths in India.**\n\n\tSuspicion of an ectopic pregnancy in women of reproductive age group presenting with lower abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding with timely case management can prevent the maternal deaths and future fertility problems in women.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Ectopic-Pregnancy\n\nextranet.who.int/rhl/topics/gynaecology-infertility-and-cancers/gynaecology-and-infertility/interventions-tubal-ectopic-pregnancy\n\nwww.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1080.html\n\n\t*Yadav A et al.

Sometimes ectopic pregnancy may be asymptomatic or women may not be aware about the pregnancy (if her menstrual periods are irregular previously or pregnancy is due to failure of contraception).\n\n\tMost women get symptoms in the 6th week of pregnancy (about 2 weeks after the missed period). The most common symptoms are unilateral lower abdominal pain, a short period of amenorrhoea, and slight vaginal bleeding.\n\n\tEctopic pregnancy may cause the following symptoms:\n\n\nVaginal bleeding often occurs (but not always). It is mostly different to the bleeding of a normal period. It may start about the time a period is due or about few weeks after the missed period.\u00a0 The bleeding may be heavier or lighter than a normal period. The blood may look darker.\n\nAbdominal or pelvic pain is felt in lower abdomen; it develops suddenly for no apparent reason or may come on gradually over several days. Pain can be sudden and sharp without relief or seems to come and go. It may occur on only one side.\n\n\n\t(These symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific and are also associated with other pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage).\n\n\tOther less common symptoms include:\n\n\n\t\tShoulder pain can be felt because of collection of blood from ruptured tube into the abdomen under the diaphragm. Pain may be worse during lying down.\n\n\t\tWomen may feel weakness, dizziness, or fainting because of blood loss; if the fallopian tube ruptures and causes internal bleeding.\n\n\t\tIn rare instances, collapse may be the first sign of an ectopic pregnancy.

A fertilized egg has difficulty passing through a damaged tube, causing the egg to implant and grow in the tube. Adnexal infections or tubal surgery can damage the fallopian tubes.

Another 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant in the cervix, ovary, peritoneal cavity, isthmic, or interstitial portion of the fallopian tube, or in uterine scars.\u00a0\n\nRisk factors- Several factors may increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy:\n\n\n\t\tPelvic inflammatory disease (PID): It is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and nearby pelvic structures and may be due to sexually transmitted infections.\n\n\t\tPrevious ectopic pregnancy: There is increased risk of ectopic pregnancy with previous ectopic pregnancy because it reflects the underlying tubal pathology which is almost always bilateral.

Early diagnosis can be made before appearance of sign and symptoms.\n\n\tThe possibility of ectopic pregnancy should be excluded in women of child bearing age, even in the absence of risk factors (such as previous ectopic pregnancy, PID), because about a third of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no known risk factors. Clinical suspicion is the key to identifying women who need prompt and careful evaluation.\n\n\tThe symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy can resemble the common symptoms and signs of other conditions such as gastrointestinal conditions or urinary tract infection.\n\n\tA detailed history, clinical examination and various tests help in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. \u00a0\n\n(a) History- A proper history and physical examination are the initial steps for initiating an appropriate work-up that will result in the accurate and timely diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\n\t\tAbdominal pain with spotting, usually occurring six to eight weeks after the last normal menstrual period is the common symptoms of tubal pregnancy in symptomatic patients. Other presentations depend on the location of the ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Less commonly ectopic pregnancy presents with pain radiating to the shoulder, vaginal bleeding, syncope and/ or signs of hypovolemic shock.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Findings such as hypotension and marked abdominal tenderness with guarding and rebound tenderness suggest a leaking or ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\n\u00a0(b)Speculum and bimanual examination have a limited diagnostic value and findings may be nonspecific.

This is usually checked every 48 hours because, with a pregnancy in the uterus, the hormone level rises by 63% every 48 hours (known as the \u2018doubling time\u2019) whereas, with ectopic pregnancies, the levels are usually lower and rise more slowly or stay the same. b-hCG level less than 1,500 mIU/mL is predictive for ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\tThe b-hCG level is more useful in distinguishing abnormal from normal pregnancies than it is for distinguishing ectopic from intrauterine pregnancies.\n\n(f) Laparoscopy-It is indicated for patients who are hemodynamically unstable with multiple signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nThe combination of sensitive urinary pregnancy tests, transvaginal ultrasound and serum hCG estimations enables the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\u00a0\n\nReferences-\n\nrcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/28.-Diagnosis-and-Management-of-Ectopic-Pregnancy.pdf\n\nwww.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg154/resources/ectopic-pregnancy-and-miscarriage-diagnosis-and-initial-management-35109631301317\n\nwww.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1080.html", "management":"In order to minimize the risks to woman\u2019s health/or to the save the woman\u2019s life treatment of ectopic pregnancy is necessary. Options of treatment depend on duration of pregnancy, clinical condition, fertility status, scan results and level of b-hCG.\n\n\tVarious treatment options are-\n\n(a) Expectant management: The term expectant management is usually defined as watchful waiting or close monitoring by a physician instead of immediate treatment. In expectant management, no treatment is given and the patient is followed closely with weekly transvaginal ultrasonography and weekly blood measurements of b-hCG until the level is less than10 mIU/mL. Expectant management may be advised when:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0An ultrasound scan shows a small ectopic pregnancy with no bleeding into the abdomen, low, declining \u03b2-hCG values and patient is willing to come for close follow-up.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\t\t\u00a0An ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but clinically fails to show an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n\n(b) Medication- Sometimes drug (systemic methotrexate) is used for the treatment of very early stages of ectopic pregnancy, when tube is not ruptured. The drug stops the further development of the pregnancy and it is gradually reabsorbed by the body leaving the fallopian tube intact.\n\n\n\t\tSuccess rates of medical treatment vary (65-95%) depending on the circumstances in which methotrexate is given.\n\n\t\tFollow up visits for few weeks are required to ensure the pregnancy has completely ended.\n\n\t\t\u00a0A reliable contraception should be used for at least 3 months.\n\n\n(c) Surgery- Surgical management is performing an operation to remove the ectopic pregnancy and it is the most established form of treatment. Surgery may also be performed if expectant management or medical management has failed.\u00a0\n\n\tAn ectopic pregnancy can be removed from the fallopian tube by using two types of surgical procedures called salpingostomy and salpingectomy. These procedures can be performed by either Laparoscopy or Laparotomy.\n\n\nLaparoscopy (keyhole surgery) -An advantage of laparoscopic surgery is that the operation is less invasive, thus recovery time is quicker and less painful as compared to a laparotomy.\n\nLaparotomy (open surgery) is usually done when there is heavy internal bleeding/rupture or presence of previous scar tissue and in an emergency situation.\n\n\nSalpingostomy- If rupture has not occurred; the products of conception are removed through a small length wise incision in the fallopian tube (linear salpingostomy). There is a very small risk that some of the products of pregnancy may remain in the tube after salpingostomy. Therefore patient is advised to have weekly blood tests to monitor hCG levels and decreased levels of hCG shows that the pregnancy is fully resolved.\n\nSalpingectomy- If the tube has already ruptured or damaged as a result of an ectopic pregnancy, salpingectomy is performed to remove the damaged fallopian tube. In this procedure a segment of fallopian tube is removed. The remaining healthy fallopian tube may be reconnected. Salpingectomy is appropriate for women who have a healthy contralateral tube.\n\nTotal salpingectomy is done in a patient who has completed childbearing and no longer desires fertility.\n\n\tTissue removed at the time of surgery can be sent for testing in the laboratory if facilities are there.\n\nFuture fertility-\n\n\n\t\tThe chances of having a successful pregnancy in the future are good. If only one fallopian tube is present, chances of conceiving are only slightly reduced.\n\n\t\tWomen who have had a previous ectopic pregnancy are at higher risk of reoccurrence.\n\n\t\tSalpingostomy and salpingectomy have the same effect on future fertility of the women when one healthy fallopian tube is present.\n\n\t\tSalpingostomy may be preferred; if other tube is damaged. This may improve the chances of\u00a0getting pregnant\u00a0in the future.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Laparoscopy and medical therapy have now emerged as the widely used therapeutic procedures with great success in terms of reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay and conservation of fertility.\n\n\nRh (rhesus) factor-\n\tAll pregnant women (including ectopic pregnancies) who are Rh-negative (determined by a blood test) should receive Rh immunoglobulin (antibodies directed against the Rh).\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg154/resources/ectopic-pregnancy-and-miscarriage-diagnosis-and-initial-management-35109631301317\n\nwww.aafp.org/afp/2000/0215/p1080.html\n\nwww.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/patients/patient-information-leaflets/pregnancy/pi-ectopic-pregnancy_final_-large-print.pdf\n\nwww.obgyn.net/tags/ectopic-pregnancy\n\nwww.ectopic.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/EPT_Expectant_Management.pdf\n\nwww.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/patients/patient-information-leaflets/pregnancy/pi-an-ectopic-pregnancy.pdf\n\nwww.ectopic.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/EPT_Surgical_Management.pdf\n\nwww.ectopic.org.uk/patients/treatment/\n\nwww.webmd.com/baby/tc/ectopic-pregnancy-surgery", "complications":"Complications-\n\n\tThe most common complication is rupture with internal bleeding which may lead to hypovolemic shock.\n\n\t\u00a0In the first trimester, ectopic pregnancy is the most common cause of pregnancy-related deaths and 10% of maternal deaths may be due to ectopic pregnancy.\u00a0\n\nReference-\n\nwww.obgyn.net/tags/ectopic-pregnancy", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":108, "name":"Hepatitis", "intro":"Exposure keratopathy refers to that surface disorder of the eye in which absence of an adequate tear film results in breakdown of the corneal epithelium. This may produce disruption of corneal epithelium, ulcer formation, superadded infection, thinning and even perforation of eyes in severe cases.\n\n\tExposure keratopathy is broadly divided into two main categories viz.\n\n\nExposure due to primary or secondary corneal anaesthesia or hypoaesthesia: Corneal sensation plays an important role in the maintenance of healthy corneal epithelium. It is presumed that nerve growth factors released by corneal nerves mediate epithelial cell proliferation. Thus, corneal anaesthesia results in a surface which is more vulnerable to injury, delayed healing of corneal epithelium, and progressive keratopathy. Reduced corneal sensation may be congenital or acquired, and may be complete or partial.\n\nExposure produced by mechanical eyelid abnormalities such as lagophthalmos: Lagophthalmos is the inability to close eyelids completely. Lagophthalmos may be divided into three main groups e.g. Proptosis causing excessive ocular surface exposure, palpebral (eyelid) insufficiency secondary to physiologic, congenital or acquired conditions, and idiopathic lagophthalmos. Lagophthalmos with or without exposure keratopathy may be present at night in some healthy individuals (nocturnal lagophthalmos).\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tExposure of cornea from any cause may lead to thickening, xerosis (dryness), and scarring of epidermis.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nFriedman Neil J, Kaiser Peter K.

 {"id":110, "name":"Hemangioma", "intro":"Early pregnancy loss is non-induced embryonic or fetal death or passage of products of conception before 20 weeks gestation. Early pregnancy loss is also termed as spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 g or less.\n\n\tSpontaneous abortion in the first trimester is common, affecting at least 15\u201320% of the clinically recognized pregnancies. Approximately 80% of all cases of pregnancy loss occur within the first three months of pregnancy (first trimester).\n\n\tAccording to March of Dimes, nearly 50% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion most often before a woman misses a menstrual period or even knows she is pregnant.\n\n\tThe different stages of spontaneous abortion may include:\n\n\n\t\tThreatened abortion (pregnancy may continue): There is vaginal bleeding without cervical dilation and abortion may or may not occur.\n\n\t\tInevitable abortion: It is a condition in which vaginal bleeding is profuse, cervix has dilated. Pregnancy will not continue and will proceed to incomplete/complete abortion.\n\n\t\tIncomplete abortion: Products of conception are partially expelled.\n\n\t\tComplete abortion: Products of conception are completely expelled.\n\n\nSeptic abortion is defined as abortion complicated by infection. Sepsis may result from infection if organisms rise from the lower genital tract following either spontaneous or unsafe abortion. Sepsis is more likely to occur if there are retained products of conception and evacuation has been delayed.\n\nRecurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20\u2013 22 weeks of gestation. The causes of RSA can be often related to factors associated with implantation, genetics, autoimmunity, endocrine abnormalities, infection, and anatomic uterine defects.\n\nMissed abortion: In missed abortion there is pregnancy loss after the development of embryo or fetus; but it is retained within the uterine cavity. There may be brownish vaginal discharge or spotting.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nAnembryonic gestation is pregnancy in which a gestational sac develops without development of any embryonic structures; previously referred to as an \u201cempty sac\u201d or \u201cblighted ovum.\n\nInduced abortion is defined as a process by which pregnancy is terminated before fetal viability.\n\nUnsafe abortion is defined as a procedure performed either by persons lacking necessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.webmd.com/baby/guide/pregnancy-miscarria\n\nwww.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-abortion-management\n\nwww.healthline.com/health/miscarriage\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/", "symtoms":"Signs and symptoms of spontaneous abortion may be:\n\n\n\t\tVaginal bleeding: The most common symptom of spontaneous abortion is vaginal bleeding with a history of delayed periods.

The fits may occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, in labour, or during the first 48 hours of the postpartum period. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of the same disorder with eclampsia being the severe form of the disease.\n\nPre-eclampsia almost always precedes eclampsia. However, not all cases follow an orderly progression from mild to severe disease and some women develop severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia very suddenly. Most cases of eclampsia present in the third trimester of pregnancy, with about 80% of eclamptic seizures occurring intrapartum (during labour) or within the first 48 hours following delivery.\n\n\tAmong the hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia and eclampsia have the greatest impact on maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Nearly one-tenth of maternal deaths in Asia and Africa and one-quarter of maternal deaths in Latin America are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Eclampsia accounts for 12% of all maternal deaths in developing countries.\n\n\tEclampsia is also an important etiological factor for maternal/perinatal morbidity and mortality in India.

Magnesium sulfate is used for both the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.\n\n\tMagnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for women with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. If possible, give a full regimen of magnesium sulfate to women with eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia. If the administration of a full regimen is not possible, these women should be given the loading dose of magnesium sulfate and should be immediately transferred to a higher-level health care facility for further treatment.\n\n\tIf magnesium sulphate is not available, diazepam may be given, but there is a greater risk of neonatal depression because diazepam crosses the placenta freely. A single dose of diazepam is unlikely to cause much neonatal depression but, if treatment continues with this drug, the risk of neonatal depression increases and the effect may last for several days.\n\n3.Controlling blood pressure:\n\n\tAntihypertensive drugs should be given if the diastolic blood pressure is 110mmHg or more. The aim is to keep the diastolic blood pressure between 90\u2013100mmHg to prevent cerebral haemorrhage. A smooth and sustained reduction in blood pressure over a three\u2013hour period is preferred to a sudden drop.\n\n4.General management and monitoring, including controlling of fluid balance:\n\n\tThe woman is nursed in a quiet, single room and must never be left alone, because she could fit at any time and inhale secretions or vomit and/or sustain serious injuries if there is no one in the room to gently restrain her.\n\n\tOnly essential care should be given such as turning the woman two\u2013hourly, mouth care, (no oral fluids are given), insert a urinary catheter and monitor the urinary output and proper fluid balance.\n\n5.Delivering the baby:\n\n\tDelivery should take place as soon as the woman\u2019s condition has stabilized, regardless of gestational age. In cases of eclampsia, delivery should occur within 12 hours of the onset of convulsions.\n\n\tMedical professional may decide the method of delivery by taking into account the. gestational age, fetal and cervical status and urgency.\n\n6.Monitoring carefully to prevent further fits and identify complications:\n\n\tFits can also recur after delivery or can occur for the first time after delivery, within the first 48 hours. Therefore, the woman must be very carefully observed for at least 48 hours after delivery.\n\n\tAnticonvulsive therapy should be maintained for 24 hours after delivery or the last convulsion, whichever occurs last.\n\n\tAntihypertensive therapy should be continued until the diastolic blood pressure decreases to less than 110mmHg.

They are taken for a few days at the time of \u00a0\u00a0period. They work by reducing the high level of a chemical (prostaglandin) in the lining of the uterus \u00a0. Prostaglandin seems to contribute to heavy and painful periods.\n\n\nMedication to shrink the fibroids:\u00a0Women are \u00a0given a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. This is a hormonal medicine that leads to low level of estrogen in body. Fibroids shrink if the level of estrogen falls. However, a low estrogen level can cause symptoms similar to the menopause (hot flushes, etc). These medications may also increase the risk of\u00a0osteoporosis. Therefore this treatment is given for a maximum period of six months. GnRH analogues, such as goserelin (eg Zoladex\u00ae) or leuprorelin acetate (eg Prostap\u00ae SR), are often prescribed for three to four months before having an operation, which will make it easier to remove fibroids. Sometimes a low dose of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is also given to reduce the incidence of menopausal side-effects.\n\nA new medication treatment undergoing trials:\u00a0A medicine called ulipristal acetate (UPA) has shown promise in preliminary research trials. This is currently used as an emergency contraceptive. It works by blocking the effects of the hormone progestogen. Progestogen is thought to play a role in fibroid development and so it was thought that this medicine may help to shrink fibroids. A small research trial has concluded that it does seem to have an effect on shrinking fibroids, with side-effects not being too troublesome. Further larger clinical trials are needed to establish whether this is indeed a good treatment option.\n\nSurgery and other operative treatments:\u00a0There are several different operations available to remove and treat fibroids.\n\nHysterectomy: This is the traditional and most common treatment for fibroids. Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus.\n\nMyomectomy: This is a possible alternative, especially in women who may wish to have children in the future. In this operation, the fibroids are removed and the uterus is left. This procedure is not always possible.\n\nEndometrial ablation: This procedure involves removing the lining of the womb. This can be done by different methods \u00a0for example, using laser energy, a heated wire loop or by microwave heating. This method is usually recommended for fibroids close to the inner lining of the uterus \u00a0\n\n\tNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

Examples include skipping, walking, running, and dancing any exercise where the body pulls on the skeleton. Older age not only results in weaker bones, but often in less physical activity, which further increases the risk of even weaker bones. It is important for people of all ages to stay physically active.\n\nThe (female) menopause - Hormones estrogen, which regulates a woman's calcium, starts to drop and continues to do so until after the menopause.

 {"id":117, "name":"High risk pregnancy", "intro":"Frostbite is a medical condition involving damage to skin and tissues due to extreme cold. Frostbite is most likely to happen in body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather. The initial stages of frostbite are sometimes called \"frost nip\". A person with frostbite on the arms or legs may also have hypothermia (lowered body temperature). Frostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals. The anatomic sites most susceptible to frostbite include hands, feet, and exposed tissues (eg, ears, nose, and lips).\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.nhs.uk\nwww.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.cdc.gov", "symtoms":"At or below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), blood vessels close to the skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities via the action of the glomus bodies (glomus bodies are most numerous in the fingers and toes. The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface when exposed to cold temperature, thus preventing heat loss, and on the other hand, it allows maximum heat flow to the skin in warm weather, to allow heat dissipation. The glomus body has a high sympathetic tone and its potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction). There are four degrees of frostbite. Each of these degrees has varying degrees of pain.\n\nFirst degree: It is known as frost nip. It only affects the surface of \u00a0\u00a0skin, which is exposed. On the onset, there is itching and pain, and then the skin develops white, red, and yellow patches and becomes numb. The area affected by frost nip usually does not become permanently damaged as only the skin's top layers are affected.\n\nSecond degree:\u00a0 If skin is exposed to cold for longer duration, then it may freeze and harden, but the deep tissues are generally not affected and remain soft and normal. Second-degree injury causes blister formation after about one or two days of exposure. The blisters may become hard and blackened, but usually appear worse than they are. Most of the injuries heal in about one month, but the area may become permanently insensitive to both heat and cold.\n\nThird and fourth degrees: If the exposed area freezes further, deep frostbite occurs. The muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves all freeze. The skin becomes hard, feels waxy, and the area is lost temporarily, and may be permanent in severe cases. The deep frostbite results in areas of purplish blisters which turn black and which are generally blood-filled. Nerve damage in the area can result in \u00a0\u00a0loss of sensations.

 {"id":118, "name":"Ichthyosis", "intro":"Filamentary keratitis is a chronic disorder in which filaments, which are adherent complexes of mucus and corneal epithelium, are present on the corneal surface. Filaments consist of a variable combination of degenerated epithelial cells and mucous which are attached to the corneal surface at one end. Filaments present as small, gelatinous strands on the anterior surface of the cornea and may vary in size, shape, composition, and distribution.\n\nLeber in 1882, first described the characteristic threads adherent to anterior surface of the cornea (Leber. Klin Monatsbl f Augenh; 1882. P. 165). Beetham in 1935, published an extensive review and potential therapy options. He outlined that the formation of filaments is due to lacrimal gland destruction and is produced by various systemic reasons viz. infection, lymphoma or hormone dysfunction (Beetham W. Filamentary Keratitis. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. 1935; 33: 413-435).\n\n\tA lack of tear production may result in the increased production of mucous by conjunctival goblet cells. Aqueous-deficient eye is characterised by excessive abnormal debris and mucous strands, which adhere firmly to the damaged areas of corneal epithelium and basement membrane, forming corneal filaments. There may be grey sub-epithelial granular opacity, beneath the attachment to the corneal epithelium. Once established, corneal filaments are firmly attached to the underlying corneal epithelium. Friction between corneal filaments and the upper lid results in pain, epithelial tears and inflammation which leads to further filament formation.\n\n\tPatients affected with filamentary keratitis are often highly symptomatic and may have persistent foreign body sensation, redness and sensitivity to light, which may vary from moderate to severe in intensity.\n\n\tFilamentary keratitis can be a functionally debilitating and sight threatening feature of a number of ocular and systemic conditions such as:\n\n\nKeratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome): Both autoimmune (Sj\u00f6gren syndrome) and non-autoimmune forms of aqueous-deficient dry eye conditions may have corneal filaments. This is the commonest cause of filamentary keratitis. Sj\u00f6gren syndrome may be primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome when these changes occur in isolation, or secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome when associated with connective tissue/ other diseases viz. systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, juvenile chronic arthritis, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis or primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is the second most common disease associated with corneal filaments.\n\nExposure keratitis.\n\nCorneal oedema. \n\nCorneal surgery e.g. corneal refractive surgery.\n\nPost-cataract surgery.\n\nUse of contact lenses.\n\nAdenoviral keratitis.\n\nHerpes simplex keratitis.\n\nBacterial keratitis.\n\nNeurotrophic keratopathy.\n\nExtended eyelid closure secondary to medications.\n\nExtended patching of eyes.\n\nAcne rosacea\n\nSystemic use of diuretics.\n\nSystemic use of antihistamines.\n\n\n\tNo associated disease is found in few cases.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.ijsrp.org/research-paper-0315/ijsrp-p3994.pdf\n\nhttp://eyewiki.aao.org/Filamentary_Keratitis\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922815\n\nhttp://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2185853\n\n\tNema HV, Nema Nitin.

Filaments are generally attached to the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium at one end, with the other end freely moveable. Filamentary keratitis is associated with underlying basement membrane abnormalities, most of which are related to hypertonic tear film states. Filaments elongate and coil with movement of the eyelids.\n\nThe ratio of mucous to aqueous is usually increased because of:\n\n\n\t\tA decrease in aqueous tear production or\n\n\t\tIncreased mucous production or\n\n\t\tAbnormal mucous accumulation.\n\n\n\tA relative deficiency in the aqueous component of tear film is usually present in cases of filamentary keratitis, which produces a relative increase in the mucinous component.\n\n\tAbnormalities of the ocular surface result in defects in the corneal epithelium that allow for anchoring of filaments.\n\nFilamentary keratitis and dry eye: \n\n\tDry eye is the disorder most frequently associated with filamentary keratitis. There is increase in tear film osmolarity due to reduced aqueous tear secretion or increased tear film stasis, which leads to increase in mucous to aqueous ratio. This imbalance of mucous to tear ratio leads to sloughing of epithelial cells and produces epithelial defects. Mucous serves as a disposal system for exfoliated epithelial cells. Increase in viscosity of mucous enhances its adherence to irregularities on corneal epithelium, thus, potential for filament formation.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of filamentary keratitis is based on the clinical history and slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy), being conducted by an eye specialist.\n\nSigns on slit lamp examination:\n\n\nCorneal filaments (mucoepithelioid strands): There may be multiple small, grey, mucoid filamentary attachments, firmly adherent to the corneal surface. Blinking causes painful traction on the filaments and may even detach them, leaving behind an epithelial corneal defect. Filaments may be stained best with rose bengal dye, but may be seen with fluorescein sodium and lissamine green stain as well.\n\n\nLocation of the filament may help determine the underlying cause,\n\nFilaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy: Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy are usually found in the interpalpebral space.\n\nFilaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis are seen superiorly on cornea.\n\nFilaments due to ocular surgery: Filaments due to ocular surgery are found at the site of wound or surgical trauma.\n\n\tFor example, filaments following corneal transplantation are seen near sutures at the graft-host junction. After cataract surgery, they may be overlying or alongside the corneal incision. Surgery-specific factors, such as the disruption of proper tear flow, pooling, toxicity from medications, and local trauma, may predispose to filament formation.\n\n\nDecreased aqueous tears: There may be decrease in aqueous tears with abnormal tear break-up time (BUT).\n\nIncreased mucinous element: Increased mucinous element in the pre-corneal tear film\n\nSuperficial punctate keratopathy.\n\nSub epithelial opacities: Sub epithelial opacities at the base of filaments.\n\nEpithelial defects: Frank corneal epithelial defects.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology:\n\n\tTraditionally, it is said that the filament is composed of mucous and degenerated epithelial cells, and is adherent to the corneal epithelium at the base.\n\nWright used histochemical stains to suggest that filaments form when mucous in the tear film attaches to receptors on the corneal surface. Subsequent proliferation of a filament occurs as mucous accumulates cellular and other degenerative material. \u00a0(Wright P. Filamentary keratitis. Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 1975; 95: 260-266).\n\nZaidman et al. used electron microscopy to report that scattered groups of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts are present below the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium where filaments are attached (Zaidman GW, Geeraets R, Paylor RR, et al. The histopathology of filamentary keratitis. Arch Ophthalmol 1985; 103:1178-1181). It is suggested that an underlying pathological process damages the basement epithelium, leading to focal areas of its detachment from Bowman\u2019s layer. This raised-epithelium subsequently becomes a nidus for mucous and degenerated cells.\n\nTanioka et al. proposed that corneal epithelium cells form the core of the filament and an admixture of multiple surface mucins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) material, and degenerated conjunctival epithelial cells become wound around the core to produce a braided shape (Tanioka H, Yokoi N, Komuro A, et al. Investigationof the corneal filament in filamentary keratitis. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2009; 50: 3696-3702).\n\nImpression cytology of the conjunctiva may show squamous metaplasia and reduced goblet cell with inflammatory cell infiltrates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922815).", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tDiagnosis of filamentary keratitis may be fairly easy but its management and resolution may be challenging.\n\n\tAny underlying disease such as dry eye disease or blepharitis is treated first, to improve the ocular surface initially. The underlying causes of filament formation, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, toxic keratoconjunctivitis, contact lens over wear, or ptosis should initially be identified and treated.\n\n\tBecause of the multi-factorial aetiology of filamentary keratitis, treatment of this disease can be frustrating for both the patient and the treating physician.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tFilamentary keratitis may be an acute or chronic condition. Some acute conditions resolve spontaneously, but more often than not, treatment is prolonged and chronic. Treatment should be given to keep the disease from progressing and to protect the corneal epithelium from additional insult due to dryness or trauma. Topical medications require their judicial use, since the cornea is more susceptible to the intrinsic and preservative toxicities of the drugs.\n\n\nTopical artificial tears: The first line of treatment is administration of topical artificial tears during the day and ointment or higher viscosity tears at bedtime. Preferably, non-preserved tear substitutes are used. Low viscosity tears may improve the tear film osmolarity, but more viscous tear substitutes can also provide substantial relief from microscopic corneal abrasions. Different tear substitutes are tried and individualised according to the benefit obtained in a particular patient. Many different tear preparations are available, and any of these may be beneficial in a given patient.\n\nTopical sodium chloride: Topical sodium chloride improves corneal epithelium by reducing oedema and obviates focal detachment in some patients.\n\nN-acetylcysteine: N-acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent which decreases the viscosity of mucous in the pre-corneal tear film. The ocular solution is not commercially available and must be formulated without preservatives from the respiratory preparation.\n\nBandage contact lens: A bandage contact lens is often successful in cases of filamentary keratitis that do not respond to ocular lubrication. The contact lens prevents the rubbing of corneal epithelium and eyelids and may help to eliminate or reduce reactive ptosis that often occurs and exacerbates the condition. High oxygen permeability soft contact lenses may be used for better tolerance. Patients should be closely monitored because of the inherent risks of contact lens wear (e.g. infective keratitis) in dry eye patients with compromised ocular surface.\n\nTopical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroid (e.g. methylprednisolone) may reduce inflammation in filamentary keratitis. A satisfactory control of symptoms and filaments may be obtained with only short bursts of therapy in most cases. Corticosteroids are reserved for acute exacerbations since they can lead to complications like raised intraocular pressure or cataract formation.\n\nTopical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation/ symptoms and accelerate resolution of disease. The toxicity of NSAIDs on the damaged epithelium in a dry eye patient should be weighed against benefits of therapy.\n\n\n\tAssociated meibomian gland dysfunction may require measures like lid hygiene, warm compresses, topical azithromycin, oral tetracycline derivatives and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n\tTopical cyclosporine may be considered in treatment of dry eye.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\nDebridement of filaments: Debridement of filaments may be done under topical anaesthesia on slit lamp. Care should be taken to remove the entire filament without damaging the corneal epithelium at the base of the filament. Post-operative topical antibiotic for several days, a pressure patch with lubricating ointment or a bandage contact lens may be prescribed to minimise discomfort.\n\nOcclusion of punctum: Punctal occlusion may increase the aqueous tear component in some cases. Temporary punctal plugs should be utilised before permanent punctal occlusion, because in many cases, temporary improvement in tear film volume can resolve filamentary keratitis. This may obviate the need for permanent punctal occlusion. Any associated meibomian gland dysfunction is treated to minimise retention of mucous in the tear film from punctal occlusion.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPrognosis of filamentary keratitis is generally good and it depends upon the effectiveness in managing the predisposing condition. At times, chronic management of this condition requires patience in both the patient and the treating physician.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"If there is high risk of frostbite for any length of time, clothing is very important.\n\n\tMake sure that\u00a0extremities, such as hands, feet, nose, ears and lips, are well protected.

 {"id":119, "name":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "intro":"Fluorosis is a crippling disease resulted from deposition of fluorides in the hard and soft tissues of body. It is a public health problem caused by excess intake of fluoride through drinking water/food products/industrial pollutants over a long period. Ingestion of excess fluoride, most commonly in drinking-water affects the teeth and bones.\u00a0\n\n\tIt results in major health disorders like dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and non-skeletal fluorosis. People exposed to large amounts of fluoride show dental effects much earlier than the skeletal effects. Dental fluorosis affects children and discolours and disfigures the teeth. Skeletal fluorosis affects the bones and major joints of the body like neck, back bone, shoulder, hip and knee joints resulting in to severe pain, rigidity or stiffness in joints. Severe forms of skeletal fluorosis results in marked disability. Non-skeletal forms of fluorosis are earlier manifestations, which develop long before the onset of typical changes in teeth and skeletal bones these are seen as gastro-intestinal symptoms and may overlap with other diseases leading to misdiagnosis. It affects men, women and children of all age groups.\n\n\tFluorosis is worldwide in distribution and endemic at least in 25 countries. It has been reported from fluoride belts: one that stretches from Syria through Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Sudan and Kenya, and another that stretches from Turkey through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India, northern Thailand and China. There are similar belts in the Americas and Japan.\n\n\tHigh levels of Fluoride were reported in 230 districts of 20 States of India (after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014). The population at risk as per population in habitations with high fluoride is 11.7 million as on 1.4.2014*. Rajasthan, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are worst affected states. Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are moderately affected states while Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam are mildly affected states.\n\n\tIn India fluorosis is mainly due to excessive fluoride in water except in parts of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh where industrial fluorosis is also seen. The desirable limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is 1ppm (parts per million or 1 mg per litre).\n\n\tThe late stages of skeletal and dental fluorosis are permanent and irreversible in nature and are detrimental to the health of an individual and the community, which in turn has adverse effects on growth, development & economy of the country.\n\n\tThe Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission started by Ministry of Rural Development worked for control of fluorosis through its awareness campaign from 1987- 1993, (coordinated by Fluorosis Control Cell at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi) had a limited coverage.\n\n\tIn 2008-09, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India launched a National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF) with the aim for prevention, diagnosis and management of fluorosis in endemic areas.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.mohfw.nic.in\n\nwww.who.int/water_sanitation_health\n\nwww.ircwash.org/sites/default/files\n\nwww.sihfwrajasthan.com/ppts/full\n\nwww.mohfw.nic.in/WriteReadData", "symtoms":"It is not necessary that all symptoms are present at the same time. The severity and duration, (which is often episodic), depend on a person\u2019s age, nutritional status, environment, kidney function, amount of fluoride ingested, genetic background, tendency to allergies, and other factors such as hardness of the water due to presence of calcium and magnesium.\n\nVarious symptoms are:\n\n\nDental fluorosis: Clinical dental fluorosis is evident by staining and pitting of the teeth. In more severe cases all the enamel may be damaged (however, fluoride may not be the only cause of dental enamel defects; enamel opacities similar to dental fluorosis are associated with other conditions, such as vitamins A and D deficiency or a low protein-energy diet). Ingestion of fluoride after six years of age will not cause dental fluorosis. The teeth could be chalky white and may have white, yellow, brown or black spots or streaks on the enamel surface. Discolouration is away from the gums and bilaterally symmetrical.\n\nSkeletal fluorosis: The early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis, include stiffness and pain in the joints. In severe cases, the bone structure may change and ligaments may calcify, with resulting impairment of muscles and pain. Constriction of vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen exerts pressure on nerves, blood vessels leading to paralysis and pain.\n\n\nNon skeletal fluorosis/ Effects of fluorosis on soft tissues /systems:\n\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal pain, excessive saliva, nausea and vomiting are seen after acute high-level exposure to fluoride.\n\nNeurological manifestation: Nervousness and depression, tingling sensation in fingers and toes, excessive thirst and tendency to urinate\n\nMuscular manifestations: Muscle weakness & stiffness, pain in the muscle and loss of muscle power, inability to carry out normal routine activities.\n\nAllergic manifestation: Skin rashes, Perivascular inflammation: pinkish red or bluish red spot, round or oval shape on the skin that fade and clear up within 7-10 days.\n\nEffects on foetus: Fluoride can also damage a foetus, if the mother consumes water/food with high concentrations of fluoride during pregnancy/breast feeding. Abortions, still births and children with birth defects are common in endemic areas.\n\nLow haemoglobin levels: Fluoride accumulates on the erythrocyte (red blood cells) membrane, which in turn looses calcium content. The membrane which is deficient in calcium content is pliable and is thrown into folds. The shape of erythrocytes is changed. Such RBCs are called echinocytes, and found in circulation. The echinocytes undergo phagocytosis (eaten-up by macrophages) and are eliminated from circulation. This would lead to low haemoglobin levels in patients chronically ill due to fluoride toxicity.\n\nUrinary tract manifestations Urine may be much less in volume; yellow-red in colour and itching in the region may occur.\n\nLigaments and blood vessel calcification: A unique feature of the disease is soft tissues like ligaments, blood vessels tend to harden and calcify and the blood vessels may be blocked.\n\n\n\tMost of these manifestations are, no doubt, nonspecific, but their occurrence in subjects living in fluorosis-endemic areas should alert suspicion. These early warning signs have been extremely helpful in early detection of large numbers of cases in rural areas; prompt intervention programmes (i.e. providing safe drinking water) in these cases have provided considerable relief within a short span of time\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.ircwash.org/sites/default\n\nwww.who.int/water_sanitation_health\n\nwww.pauapress.com/fluoride\n\nwww.mohfw.nic.in/WriteReadData", "causes":"Fluorosis is caused by excessive intake of fluorides from multiple sources such as in food, water, air (due to gaseous industrial waste), and excessive use of toothpaste. However, drinking water is the most significant source.\n\n\tModerate-level chronic exposure (above 1.5 mg/litre of water - the WHO guideline value for fluoride in water) is more common. Acute high-level exposure to fluoride is rare and usually due to accidental contamination of drinking-water or due to fires or explosions.\n\n\tFluoride in water is mostly of geological origin. Water with high levels of fluoride content are mostly found at the foot of high mountains and in areas where geological deposits are collected in sea. The drinking water fluoride so far detected in the country ranges from 0.2 to 48 mg/ litre. The desirable limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is 1ppm.\n\nOther risk factors-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\t\tSeveral of the ready to serve foods, beverages, snacks have high content of black rock salt (CaF2) or \u2018kala namak\u2019 (which has 157ppm fluoride) and red rock salts.\n\n\t\tTobacco or supari (aracanut) when they are chewed.\n\n\t\tIntake of certain drugs such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, few anti-depressants, some anti-fungal drugs, cholesterol-lowering drugs, steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis drugs, antacids, drugs for osteoporosis and otosclerosis. and\u00a0numerous other drugs that contain fluoride\u00a0can contribute to fluoride toxicity over time.\n\n\t\tPerson with calcium deficiency or malnourished individuals appear to be more prone to develop dental and skeletal fluorosis.\n\n\t\tFluoridated toothpastes: Indian studies have also shown that absorption of fluoride takes place within minutes after brushing the teeth with fluoridated toothpaste; the saliva from the oral cavity when analyzed for fluoride has also revealed high fluoride content.\n\n\t\tFluoridated beverages.\n\n\t\tFluoride-rich foods such as tea, ocean fish, gelatin, skin of chicken, fluoridated salt, food contaminated with post-harvest fumigants (e.g. sulfuryl fluoride) and pesticides (e.g. sodium aluminium fluoride, Na3AlF6, which may be used on grapes).\n\n\t\tFluoride from any other environmental sources, including cigarette smoke and industrial pollution, e.g. fluoride in dust and fumes from industries such as those manufacturing steel, aluminum, enamel, pottery, glass, bricks, phosphate fertilizer, and others involved with power, welding, water fluoridation plants, refrigeration, rust removal, oil refining, plastics, pharmaceuticals, tooth-paste, chemicals, and automobiles.\n\n\t\tDiets rich in fat have been reported to increase deposition of fluoride in bones.\n\n\t\tIt is also known that fluorosis, in its severe forms, is mostly restricted to a particular climate zone in the world -- the areas with semi-arid tropical conditions. In these areas, the consumption of drinking water is high and the population is more vulnerable to the disease as compared to their counterparts in colder areas with low consumption of water, though the fluoride content of water in both the areas may be the same.\n\n\t\tDental fluorosis can only occur if the fluoride exposure is during the first years of life while the teeth are forming.\n\n\t\tIn China, fluoride toxicity occurs with: brick tea and food contaminated with fluoride during drying of chilies and corn with coal briquettes.\n\n\nMechanism after fluoride intake: Once fluoride enters the body either through the blood vessels in the mouth or through the gastrointestinal route, it reaches the various organs and tissues in the body. Fluoride (F) being an electronegative element, having a negative charge is attracted by positively charged ions like calcium (Ca++). Bone and tooth having highest amount of calcium in the body, attract the maximum amount of fluoride and is deposited as calcium fluorapatite crystals. At the same time, from certain areas in the bone and tooth, the unbound calcium is lost.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/water_sanitation_health\n\nwww.toxicteeth.org/health/bone/fluorosis\n\nwww.mohfw.nic.in/WriteReadData\n\nwww.sihfwrajasthan.com/ppts/full/Fluorosis\n\nwww.icmr.nic.in/000519/updatevol1no2.pdf\n\nwww.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/\n\nwww.pauapress.com/fluoride/files/\n\nwww.mohfw.nic.in/WriteReadData", "diagnosis":"All the substances containing fluoride should be avoided during diagnosis.

A person with skeletal fluorosis would not be able to lift the coin without flexing the large joints of lower extremity (unable to bend without bending knee, test is present in other disease also).\n\n\t(b) Chin Test: The subject is asked to touch the anterior wall of the chest with the chin. If there is pain or stiffness in the neck, he/she is unable to bend the neck-touching the chest with chin is not possible.\n\n\t(c) Stretch Test: The individual is made to stretch the arm sideways, fold at elbow and touch the back of the head. When there is pain and stiffness, it would not be possible to touch the back of the head.\n\n(ll)Radiographs: X-ray would reveal increased girth, thickening and density of bone, ligaments calcified. Maximum ill effects of fluoride are detected in the neck, spine, knee, pelvic and shoulder joints. It also affects small joints of the hands and feet.\n\n(lll)SA/GAG test (Sialic acid / Glycosaminoglycan test) -The SA/GAG test is for early detection/diagnosIs of fluoride toxicity. The value of SA/GAG will be reduced in fluorosis and will be significantly elevated in ankylosing spondylitis.

If the subject has been ingesting food, water, drugs or any other substance contaminated with fluoride, urinary fluoride is bound to be high. (There is another possibility that , when an individual moves out of an endemic area and start living in a non-endemic area, there is a tendency for excreting high levels of fluoride for short duration of time (viz 1-2 months) and the subject will also have less pain in the joints and other regions.

It is characterised by loose floppy eyelids associated with punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK), ptosis of lateral eyelashes and typical conjunctival changes.\n\n\tFloppy eyelid syndrome was described initially by Culbertson and Ostler (1981). Prior to this, it was not recognised as a specific entity. The syndrome was seen in overweight male patients with floppy, rubbery, and easily everted upper eyelids. It may be associated with a variable chronic papillary conjunctivitis of the upper palpebral conjunctiva.\n\n\tIt affects patients of both sexes ranging in age from two to eighty years, but it affects more commonly middle-aged obese males. The floppiness of the eyelids is due to laxity of the tarsus. Decrease in tarsal elastin contributes to the laxity of eyelids.\n\n\tIn addition to involvement of anterior segment, FES may also be associated with glaucoma and papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure.\n\n\tA number of systemic diseases may be associated with FES, such as diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism and hypertension. These diseases may correlate better with preponderance of patients with obesity in this disorder.

Excessive fluoride intake and its adverse effects can be minimized or prevented by adapting following measures:\n\n\n\t\tby using alternative water sources,\n\n\t\tby removing excessive fluoride from drinking water,\n\n\t\tby improving the nutritional status of population/individuals at risk.\n\n\n(a)\u00a0 Using alternative water resources include surface water, rainwater, and low fluoride ground water:\n\n\nSurface water: If surface water is used for drinking purposes particular caution is required, since it is often contaminated with biological and chemical pollutants. Surface water should be used after proper disinfection with simple and low cost method such as sand filtration, ultraviolate disinfection; chlorination (may be adequate in some places but not all places.)\n\nRainwater: It is usually cleaner and low cost simple source, but problem is for large storage of water and large reservoir in the communities and households.\n\nLow fluoride ground water- fluoride content can vary in wells in the same area, depending on the geological structure of the aquifer and the depth at which water is drawn. Deepening tube wells and digging new wells in another site may be helpful. Fluoride is unevenly distributed in ground water both vertically and horizontally.\n\n\n(b)Defluoridation of water (removing excessive fluoride from drinking water):\n\n\tUse of safe drinking water with safe fluoride levels is the preferred option for the prevention of fluorosis; however access to safe water in fluorosis endemic areas is limited.\n\n\tThe de-fluoridation is the only solution; this can be done by different methods:\n\n(i) Chemical precipitation-Alum coagulation (Nalgonda technique), Electrolyte defluoridation\n\n\nAlum coagulation/Flocculation: The Nalgonda technology (named after Nalgonda in Andhra Pradesh, India, where first community de-fluoridation plant was set up) is based on the principle of flocculation. This technique was developed by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur, India.Raw water is mixed with aluminum sulphate (alum: hydrate aluminum salt)), lime or sodium carbonate (1/20th of alum, as process is best carried out under alkaline conditions) and bleaching powder (3 mg/l, is added to disinfect the water).Technique is suitable for community and house hold levels. At household level a bucket of water (20 liters) is mixed with alum, lime and bleaching ( doses of alum and lime are determined after assessing the fluoride content and alkalinity of water) and left for \u00a0coagulation and settling of the flocks at the bottom of bucket for at least one hour. The treated water is withdrawn through a tap 5 cm above the bottom of the bucket, safely above the sludge level. Store the water for the drinking purposes in another bucket and discard the sludge.\n\nElectrolyte defluoridation: Solar Energy Based Electrolytic Plants are installed by NEERI in few endemic areas of fluorosis. In this process when direct current is passed through the aluminum electrodes in water (containing excessive fluoride), active species of hydroxide of aluminum are produced;\u00a0which adsorb the fluoride ions present in the water resulting in the formation of the sludge and treated water (which is used for drinking).In areas having a power crisis, a system running on solar energy can be incorporated. Dried sludge can be disposed in the land filling or may be used in brick making.\n\n\n(ii)Adsorption: This approach is to filter water down through a column packed with a strong adsorbent such as activated alumina (AL2O3), activated charcoal, or ion exchange resins. This method is also suitable for both community and household levels. Once adsorbent become saturated with fluoride ions filter is backwashed with a mild acid or alkali solution, as the backwashing material is rich in fluoride, it should be disposed off carefully so that not re contaminating nearby ground water.\n\n\tAll methods produce sludge with very high concentration of fluoride (that has to be disposed of); therefore only water for drinking and cooking purposes should be treated, particularly in the developing countries.\n\n(iii) Ionic separation-\n\n\n\t\tReverse Osmosis Filtration\n\n\t\tElectrodialysis\n\n\n(c) Better nutrition: measures to improve nutritional status (intake of calcium and vitamin C, iron,antioxidants) of affected population particulary children are an effective supplement to technical solutions mentioned above. Mothers in affected areas should be encouraged to breastfeed since breast milk is usually low in fluoride.\n\nFollowing procedures do not remove fluoride:\n\n\nBoiling water: will concentrate fluoride content rather than removing it.\n\nFreezing water: does not affect concentration of fluoride.\n\nActivated carbon: filters do not remove fluorides.\n\n\nHealth Education:\n\n\n\t\tSensitizing the community with information on fluorosis, importance of drinking safe water and about healthy diet are important for prevention and control of fluorosis.\n\n\t\tWater contaminated with fluoride more than 1ppm should not be consumed.\n\n\t\tHigh fluoride containing products viz., Supari, tobacco, black rock salt, red rock salt (Sindhi),\u00a0 Drugs and cosmetics like toothpaste, mouth rinses and any other products proven to have high fluoride should be avoided.\n\n\t\tIntake of foods (rich in calcium, iron, vitamin c, other antioxidants), such as milk, curd, green leafy vegetables, fruits should be advocated.\n\n\nHuman Resource Development: to develop adequate human resource both in Health and Public Health Engineering Sectors. Special focus is laid on updating the information for medical personnel/doctors to recognize the disease. In a similar manner, the focus for public health engineering department/ integrated child development services (ICDS) and other departments is to practice early detection of endemic areas and proper water management.\n\nNational Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF)*: \n\n\tMinistry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India during 11th five year plan started the programme with the aim to prevent and control fluorosis in the country. Programme is initiated in 2008-09 and is being expanded in a phased manner.100 districts of 17 states were covered during 11th Plan, further 11 districts were taken up during 2013-15 (over 19 states) and additional 84 new districts are to be taken up during the remaining period of 12th Plan.

The term factitious disorders describe conditions where physical findings are intentionally produced by person to assume sick role.\n\n\tFactitious disorder most commonly occurs during second or third decade of life, and more often among health professionals. Factitious disease affecting eyes is commonly seen in nasal or inferior quadrant of the eye. Topical anaesthetic abuse is one of the most common self-induced injuries to the eye.\n\n\tWe, as clinician, tend to find aetiology underlying any eye disease. Therefore, self-inflicted injuries often do not draw attention. Self-injuring patients often reach out for help but are incapable of describing what help is required. Failure in diagnosis of such disease may delay therapy to prevent permanent damage.\n\n\tFactitious disorders must be distinguished from malingering and somatoform disorders. In malingering, in addition to intentionally induced physical features, there is always evidence of external incentive. Malingering may be adaptive as in prisoners of war, and does not necessarily mean psychopathology. Somatoform disorders produce clinical findings which are not fully explained. Somatoform disorders include conditions such as hypochondriasis and hysteria.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nSundaram Venki, Barsam Allon, Barker Lucy, Khaw Peng Tee.

However, symptoms can be treated with both non-drug measures and medication based treatments. Many times the best outcomes are achieved by using multiple types of treatments.\n\nNon-Drug Therapies:\u00a0People with fibromyalgia can use non-drug therapies as well as medicines suggested by their doctors. Following are some non drug therapy measures to manage fibromyalgia:\n\nPatient\u2019s self-care is an important aspect to improving symptoms and daily functions of a person having fibromyalgia. Healthy lifestyle behaviour can reduce pain, increase sleep quality, lessen fatigue and help to cope better with fibromyalgia.\n\nRegular Exercise: It is reported that regular exercise is one of the most effective treatments for fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia who have too much pain or fatigue should begin with walking or other gentle exercise (water aerobics and/or stretching exercises) and build their endurance and intensity\u00a0slowly. Patients should follow the saying, \u201cStart low, go slow.\u201d It takes time to create a comfortable routine. Just get moving, stay active and don't give up.\n\nMake time to relax each day: Deep-breathing exercises and meditation will help reduce the stress that can bring on symptoms. It\u2019s also important to manage daily schedule with time to rest and relax. Persons with fibromyalgia should avoid making too many commitments that can make them fatigue.\n\nSet a regular sleep pattern: Patient should go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Getting enough sleep will help body to repair itself, physically and mentally. Avoid daytime napping and limit caffeine intake, which can disrupt sleep. For those who smoke, they should stop smoking (nicotine is a stimulant and aggravates sleep problems).\n\nLook forward, not backward: Person with fibromyalgia should focus on tasks need to do to get better, not what caused the illness. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day.\n\nKeep dietary habits healthy: Person should try to eat a healthy, balanced diet. Proper nutrition can help body stay healthy and provide a constant supply of energy and nutrients so that symptoms of fibromyalgia may not get worse.\n\nEducate yourself about illness; and share the information with family, friends and co-workers.\n\nMoist heat can be used to relieve deep muscle pain and stiffness like moist heating pad, warm bath or shower.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT and related treatments, such as mindfulness, can help patients learn symptom reduction skills that lessen pain. CBT is based on understanding that how thoughts and behaviours can affect pain and other symptoms. Mindfulness is a non-spiritual meditation practice that cultivates present moment awareness and has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of fibromyalgia.\n\nOther complementary and alternative therapies (sometimes called CAM or integrative medicine), such as acupuncture, chiropractic and massage therapy, yoga and tai chi can be useful to manage fibromyalgia symptoms (though many of these treatments have not been well tested in patients with fibromyalgia).\n\nManage risk factors-It is important to address risk factors and triggers for fibromyalgia including sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, and mood problems such as stress, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. This may require involvement of other specialists such as a sleep medicine doctor, psychiatrist.\n\nDrug therapy-\n\n\tInitial management of fibromyalgia involves patient education with focus on non-pharmacological therapies. Though in non-responsive patients, pharmacological therapies should be added especially to those with sleep or mood disturbances.\n\n\tDrugs like pregabalin, gabapentin (which work by blocking the over activity of nerve cells involved in pain transmission) may be used for management of pain of fibromyalgia. These medicines may cause dizziness, sleepiness, swelling and weight gain.\n\n\tThe antidepressants duloxetine and milnacipran, which are used to relieve pain, fatigue, and sleep problems, are generally used at lower doses than for treatment of depression.\n\n\tSeveral medications are avoided or used carefully. Opioids, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and certain skeletal-muscle relaxants are used with caution because of the potential for abuse and the risk of worsening fatigue and cognitive dysfunction.\n\n\tOver-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or naproxen are not effective for fibromyalgia pain. These drugs may be useful to treat the pain triggers of fibromyalgia such as arthritis.\n\n\tFor sleep problems, some of the medicines that treat pain also improve sleep. These include cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin. Sleeping medicines like zolpidem or benzodiazepine medications are not recommended in patients with fibromyalgia.\n\nVitamin D\u00a0supplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in this\u00a0vitamin.\n\nReferences-\n\nnccih.nih.gov/health/pain/fibromyalgia.htm\n\nwww.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Fibromyalgia\n\nwww.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/fibromyalgia/articles/fibro-fog.php", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

FGM comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons1.\n\n\tEvery year about 3 million girls and women are at risk of FGM2. FGM can have a negative effect on several aspects of a girl\u2019s or woman\u2019s life, including her physical, mental and sexual health and her relationship with her husband or partner and other close family members.\n\n\tFGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is more common3.\u00a0\n\n\tFGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.\n\nHuman Rights violated by the practice of FGM4:\n\n\n\t\tRight to the highest attainable standard of health\n\n\t\tRight to life and physical integrity, including freedom from violence\n\n\t\tRight to freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\n\n\t\tRight to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex\n\n\t\tRights of the child\n\n\n\tThe practice is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. In many settings, health care providers perform FGM due to the erroneous belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized. WHO strongly urges health professionals not to perform such procedures.\n\n\tIn 2008, the World Health Assembly passed resolution (WHA61.16) on the elimination of FGM, emphasizing the need for concerted action in all sectors - health, education, finance, justice and women's affairs. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation3.\n\n\tIn 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) includes a target under Goal 5 to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM/C, by the year 2030.\n\nReferences-\n\n\t1.apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272429/9789241513913-eng.pdf?ua=1\n\n\t2.www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation\n\n\t3.www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf\n\n\t4.apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/206437/9789241549646_eng.pdf;jsessionid=C292C2BFCE6616EA6E61616EB86DD7F8?sequence=1", "symtoms":"Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.\n\n\tImmediate complications can include:\n\n\n\t\tsevere pain\n\n\t\texcessive bleeding (severe haemorrhage can lead to anaemia))\n\n\t\tgenital tissue swelling\n\n\t\tfever\n\n\t\turinary problems\n\n\t\tinfections e.g., tetanus\n\n\t\twound healing problems\n\n\t\tinjury to surrounding genital tissue\n\n\t\tshock\n\n\t\thaemorrhage and infection can be severe enough to cause death.\n\n\n\tLong-term effects of FGM can include:\n\n\n\t\turinary problems (painful urination, urinary tract infections);\n\n\t\tvaginal problems (discharge, itching, bacterial vaginosis and other infections);\n\n\t\tmenstrual problems (painful menstruations, difficulty in passing menstrual blood, etc.);\n\n\t\tscar tissue and keloid;\n\n\t\tsexual problems (pain during intercourse, decreased satisfaction, etc.);\n\n\t\tincreased risk of childbirth complications (difficult delivery, excessive bleeding, caesarean section, need to resuscitate the baby, etc.) and newborn deaths;\n\n\t\tneed for later surgeries: for example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening (type 3) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth (deinfibulation).\n\n\t\tpsychological problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, low self-esteem, etc.).

More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk for FGM annually1.\n\n\tThe practice is most common in the western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, in some countries the Middle East and Asia, as well as among migrants from these areas. FGM is therefore a global concern2.\n\n\tCultural and social factors for performing FGM:\n\n\tFGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way such as- a rite of passage into womanhood, to preserve a girl\u2019s virginity until marriage. Following are some reasons:\n\n\tRespect for tradition: Community members, including the women see it as a sign of respect towards the elder members of the community.\n\n\tRite of passage: In many cultures, FGM constitutes an important rite of passage into adulthood for girls. It may be considered a necessary step towards being viewed as a respectable adult woman.\n\n\tSocial convention: Those who adhere to the practice may be better accepted in their communities, while those who do not may face condemnation, harassment and exclusion.\n\n\tEnhance fertility: In some practicing communities, women and men believe that if a woman is not cut she will not be able to become pregnant or she may face difficulties during labour.\n\n\tMarriageability: There is often an expectation that men will marry only women who have undergone FGM. The desire and pressure to be married, and the economic and social security that may come with marriage, can perpetuate the practice in some settings.\n\n\tEnsure virginity, chastity and faithfulness:\u00a0 FGM is believed to safeguard a girl\u2019s or woman\u2019s virginity prior to marriage and ensure fidelity after marriage.\n\n\tCleanliness and beauty: In some communities, FGM is performed in order to make girls \u201cclean\u201d and beautiful. Cleanliness may refer to the body, but it may also refer to spiritual purity.\n\n\tFemininity: The removal of genital parts that are considered masculine (i.e. the clitoris) is considered to make girls more feminine, respectable and beautiful.\n\n\tReligion: Some communities believe that FGM is a religious requirement, and some religious leaders may promote the practice, even though it is not mentioned in any major religious texts3,4.\n\nMedicalization of FGM:\n\n\tMedicalization of FGM refers to situations in which FGM is practised by any category of health-care provider, whether in a public or a private clinic, at home or elsewhere. It also includes the procedure of re-infibulation at any time in a woman\u2019s life.\n\n\t(Re-infibulation: The procedure to narrow the vaginal opening in a woman after she has been deinfibulated (such as after childbirth); also known as re-suturing2.\n\nTypes of FGM\n\n\tFemale genital mutilation is classified into 4 major types:\n\n\nType 1:\u00a0Often referred to as\u00a0clitoridectomy, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris).\n\nType 2:\u00a0Often referred to as\u00a0excision, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without excision of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).\n\nType 3 (infibulation):\u00a0Often referred to as infibulation. This is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).\n\nType 4:\u00a0This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area2.\n\n\n\tReferences-\n\n\t1www.unicef.org/media/files/FGMC_2016_brochure_final_UNICEF_SPREAD.pdf\n\n\t2.www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation\n\n\t3\u00a0apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/272429/9789241513913-eng.pdf?ua=1", "diagnosis":"Health-care providers working in regions where FGM is a common practice and those seeing patients from these regions should always include direct questions about FGM-related gynaecological and urogenital complications when taking a medical history from their female patients1. \u00a0As girls and women living with FGM often do not seek care for such type of symptoms until the symptoms are advanced or cannot be hidden.\n\n\tOnce it has been established that the girl or woman has undergone any type of FGM, this information and the subsequent clinical examination should be done with proper care.

 {"id":124, "name":"Japanese Encephalitis", "intro":"Gangrene is a condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies (necrosis) . This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. Gangrene is primarily caused due to reduced blood supply to the affected tissues that leads to cell death. Diseases like diabetes and long-term smoking increases the risk of gangrene. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands (the extremities).\n\nTypes of gangrene:\n\nDry gangrene: Dry gangrene begins at the distal part of the limb due to ischemia (restricted supply of blood), and often appears in the toes and feet of elderly patients due to arteriosclerosis and thus, it is also known as senile gangrene. Dry gangrene is generally seen due to arterial occlusion. As there is limited putrefaction and bacteria fail to survive, dry gangrene spreads slowly until it reaches the point where the blood supply is adequate to keep tissue viable. The affected part is dry, shrunken and dark reddish-black, like mummified flesh.\n\nWet gangrene: Wet gangrene occurs in moist tissues and organs such as the mouth, bowel, lungs, cervix, and vulva. Bed sores occurring on body parts such as the sacrum, buttocks, and heels are also classified as wet gangrene infections. Wet gangrene is characterized by numerous bacteria and generally has a poor prognosis (compared to dry gangrene) due to septicaemia. In wet gangrene, the tissue is infected by microorganisms like Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus fusiformis that causes the tissues to swell and emit a foetid smell. Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of venous (mainly) and/or arterial blood flow. The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood,that promotes \u00a0rapid growth of bacteria.\n\nGas gangrene: Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produce gas within tissues. It is the most severe form of gangrene usually caused by Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by bacteria expand and infiltrate healthy tissues in the vicinity.Gas gangrene is generally treated as a medical emergency as it quickly spreads to the surrounding tissues.\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.nhs.uk\nwww.merckmanuals.com\nwww.nlm.nih.gov", "symtoms":"Dry gangrene which is the most common type of gangrene, usually manifests in the following form.\u00a0\n\u2022 Firstly, the affected part turns red\n\u2022 Then it becomes cold, pale and numb (though some people might experience pain).\n\u2022\u00a0Furthermore, the body part may begin to change colour from red to brown to black without treatment.

Some health care providers are also under the misconception that by carrying out FGM they are preventing harm to girls or women. There is no medical justification for FGM, and medical practitioners carrying out FGM on girls and women are causing only harm.\n\n\tIn the recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of FGM operations carried out by trained health-care personnel. However, World Health Organisation is strongly opposed to health care providers carrying out FGM1,2.\n\n\tThere is a challenge not only protecting girls who are currently at risk but also ensuring that those to be born in the future will be free from the dangers of the practice.

 {"id":126, "name":"Kala-azar/ Leishmaniasis", "intro":"What is Glaucoma?\n\n\tGlaucoma is a term used to describe a group of diseases of the eye characterized by progressive and irreversible damage to the optic nerve (nerve of the eye responsible for vision) and which if untreated can lead to blindness. Though raised pressure of the eye (pressure maintained by fluid in the eye) is an important risk factor, a few individuals can develop glaucoma even with normal pressure of the eye.\n\nTypes of glaucoma\n\n\tGlaucoma can be classified into four basic types based on the event initiating damage. They include\n\n\n\t\tPrimary open-angle glaucoma\u00a0\n\n\t\tPrimary angle-closure glaucoma\n\n\t\tDevelopmental glaucoma (which affects children)\n\n\t\tSecondary glaucoma (which occurs due to other disorders of the eye or the body )\n\n\nThe disease burden\n\n\tGlaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world accounting for upto 8% of total blindness. In India , glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness with atleast 12 million people affected and nearly 1.2 million people blind from the disease. More than 90 percent of cases of glaucoma remain undiagnosed in the community.\n\nThe content of this module has been validated by Dr Tanuj Dada, RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi on 17/3/2015.", "symtoms":"Primary open angle glaucoma presents as a chronic disease and usually has no symptoms in its early stages and the vision remains normal. As the optic nerve is more damaged, peripheral (side) vision is lost progressively till only the central vision is left resulting in tunnel vision (as if looking through the end of a narrow tunnel).\n\n\tPrimary angle closure glaucoma can present either as a chronic disease as said above or as an acute attack. The symptoms of an acute attack include sudden blurring of vision, pain in the eyes, headache, nausea, vomiting and seeing rainbow like rings around lights. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tSecondary glaucoma result from other predisposing conditions of the eye or body and \u00a0may be asymptomatic or present with the symptoms of predisposing conditions like trauma, uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye) and so on.\n\n\tDevelopmental glaucoma affects children. It can present with large eyes, whitening of the cornea (front part of the eye), excessive tearing, sensitivity to light (closure of eyes on light exposure), jerky movements of the eyes and squinting of the eyes (condition in which one of the eyes turns inwards or outwards as the other eye looks forward).", "causes":"Glaucoma is of multifactorial etiology and raised pressure of the eye is the most important among them and the only modifiable risk factor. As already mentioned, though raised eye pressure is a risk factor, glaucoma can occur even in individuals with normal pressure. The most common abnormality of the eye leading to raised pressure of the eye is an abnormal drainage angle (angle is a structure of the eye where the fluid produced inside the eye exits). This abnormality of the angle causes obstruction to the flow of the fluid which accumulates inside the eye and causes pressure on the optic nerve leading to progressive damage and loss of vision. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWho is at risk?\n\n\tAlthough glaucoma can affect anyone in any age group, some individuals are at higher risk than others. Common risk factors include elevated pressure of the eye, age over 40 years, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, use of steroid-containing medications (eye drops/ pills/inhalers/ skin creams), those with higher refractive error (power) of the eyes , patients with history of blunt eye injury, history of hypertension and diabetes.", "diagnosis":"The diagnosis of glaucoma is based on a review of history pertaining to the above said symptoms and risk factors, a comprehensive eye examination and several tests to support the diagnosis. Tests which are used in the diagnosis of glaucoma include \u2013 measurement of pressure of the eye using an instrument called tonometer, a look at the optic nerve head with an ophthalmoscope or stereoscopic evaluation on the slit lamp with a 90D lens, evaluation of the drainage system \u2013 anterior chamber angle of eye using an instrument called the gonioscope, testing of field of vision of each eye using an instrument known as the perimeter, measurement of thickness of cornea with a pachymeter. Specialized tests done for early detection of glaucoma and follow up include photography of the optic nerve , optical coherence tomography, scanning laser polarimetry and confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope.", "management":"Glaucoma management aims at maintaining the vision related quality of life of the patient throughout his/her lifetime with minimal possible medications at a sustainable cost. The treatment helps to control the disease process so that further damage to the optic nerve can be prevented. There is no cure for glaucoma and treatment cannot restore visual loss but only prevent further deterioration. In the current day practice, reduction of pressure of the eye remains the only modifiable risk factor. Hence the management of glaucoma revolves around the effective control of pressure of the eye with three modalities :\n\n\tMedical therapy with ocular hypotensive medications, laser therapy and glaucoma surgery.\n\n\tThe most important consideration in the management is that once a diagnosis of glaucoma is made, treatment and regular follow-ups are required lifelong.\u00a0\n\nMedical management\u00a0\n\n\tMedical management remains the first line of treatment in most of the glaucomas. These medications either decrease the secretion of fluid of the eye or increase its exit through the drainage angle. These agents are available as either eye drops or pills. Currently, following medicines are available to control pressure of the eye. They include- prostaglandin analogues, beta adrenergic blockers, alpha adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, parasympathomimetic agents and hyperosmotic agents.\n\n\tPatients who are prescribed with these eye drops have to observe the following precautions.\n\n\n\t\tThe drops have to be instilled as advised by the doctor. Failure to instill drops as prescribed will lead to fluctuations in pressure of the eye and damage to the optic nerve. Probably the best way to put drops is to schedule the instillation with a daily activity like brushing teeth, breakfast or dinner. \u00a0\n\n\t\tTo prevent the drops from spilling around the eye, the patient has to widely open the lids and directly look into the tip of the dropper and instill only one drop at a time.\u00a0\n\n\t\tTo minimize the absorption into the bloodstream and prevent untoward side effects on the body, the eye has to be closed for one or two minutes and the eyelid pressed gently at the corner of the eyes near to nose.\u00a0\n\n\t\tPatients prescribed with more than one type of eye drop at one time, have to maintain a gap of 5-10 minutes between two different drop\u00a0 instillation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\tThe drops need to be instilled even during the time of travel or during hospital visits.\n\n\nLaser Therapy\n\n\tThe initial management of primary angle closure disease is laser iridotomy (making a small hole in the iris to bypass pupillary block) usually done with a YAG laser. Laser trabeculoplasty can be performed to lower IOP in patients with Primary open angle glaucoma.\n\nSurgical management\u00a0\n\n\tSurgical therapy is required in patients who are intolerant to medical therapy or in whom medical therapy is considered ineffective to control pressure of the eye. Surgical therapy \u00a0like the medical therapy does not improve the lost visual function, but help \u00a0to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Some cases may require continuation of eye drops after surgery for better control of pressure of the eye.\u00a0\n\n\nFiltration surgery \u2013 this is the most commonly practiced glaucoma surgery for controlling raised pressures. This surgery aims to create a new channel for the exit of eye fluid, bypassing the usual route of drainage i.e. the angle and created subconjunctival filtration.\u00a0\n\nGlaucoma drainage devices \u2013 they are used in patients with previously failed filtration surgeries and also in some patients with advanced secondary glaucomas. These procedures involve insertion of a small tube into the eye which is used to facilitate the drainage of the eye fluid from the eye.\u00a0\n\nCyclodestructive procedures \u2013 in a painful blind eye , diode laser cyclophotocoagulation or cyclocryotherapy is performed to permanently reduce aqueous formation by the ciliary body and give the patient symptomatic relief.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement and nerves that transmit feelings of pain, temperature and touch. This leads to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling and sometimes paralysis.\n\n\tMost people recover fully from GBS, but some people have long-term nerve damage. 3%-5% of GBS patients may die from complications, which include paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, blood infection, lung clots or cardiac arrest.\n\n\tThe cause of this condition is unknown, but it\u2019s typically triggered by an infectious illness, such as the gastrointestinal infection or a lung infection. Few countries from Europe and Asia have reported familial occurrence of GBS (42 GBS patients found from 20 families). In a hospital based study from South India among 150 GBS cases reported during 10 years period, 2 cases belonged to a single familya.\n\n\tAccording to WHO overall incidence of GBS is 0.4 to 4.0 people per 100 000 per year.

Since GPC is predominantly associated with the use of contact lenses (CLs), the disease is also referred to as contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC).\n\n\tGPC is an inflammatory condition seen in upper tarsal conjunctiva, initially reported by Spring in 1974 (Spring TF, Reaction to hydrophilic lenses, Med J Aust 1974; 1:449-50). A papillary reaction, similar to the one with allergic conjunctivitis, occurs in soft contact lens wearers. Allansmith and colleagues further detailed the syndrome, suggesting that it may be immunologic in origin, with the proteinaceous deposits on the contact lenses, serving as the antigen (Allansmith MR, Korb DR, Greiner JV, et. al. Giant papillary conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers. Am J Ophthalmol 1977; 83:697-708).\n\n\tGPC, a non-infectious inflammatory disorder was originally named for the presence of giant papillae (1.0mm or greater in diameter) along the upper tarsal surface. However, papillae measuring 0.3mm or greater are now considered abnormal and a feature of this condition.\n\n\tGPC is most often associated with wearing soft (hydro-gel) contact lenses, though it can occur with any type of contact lens. The contact lens type, material, wearing schedule, cleaning process and length of time lenses have been worn contribute to the severity of the disease, with soft lens wearers suffering from more severe manifestations of disease than counterparts in rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses. Silicone hydro-gel lenses also appear to have similar effects with prolonged use. Incidence among extended wearers is supposed to be higher than the daily wearers of soft lenses.\n\n\tWith an increased frequency of contact lens replacement from more than four weeks to a period less than that, the incidence of GPC reduces. Both sexes develop GPC. GPC may be more aggressive in children who wear contact lenses.\n\nThe condition has also been reported in patients with:-\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular dermoids.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular prosthesis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exposed sutures/ knots following ocular procedures (such as monofilament nylon sutures).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extruded scleral buckles.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Glaucoma filtering blebs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal surface irregularity.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exposed corneal deposits.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tissue adhesives.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even elevated corneal scars.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dry eye is a common association, especially with contact lens wearer.\n\n\tA related phenomenon is the so called \u2018mucus fishing syndrome\u2019, when, in a variety of underlying anterior segment disorders, patients develop or exacerbate a chronic papillary reaction due to repetitive manual removal of mucus. Giant papillae can also be seen in other conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC).\n\n\tOne study suggests that patients who suffer from allergies seem to have more severe signs and symptoms of GPC. Significant correlation between GPC and other forms of allergy like rhinitis, hay fever and environmental allergy were found. Giant papillary conjunctivitis can follow seasonality similar to that of environmental allergies.\n\n\tBecause of the high prevalence of GPC in contact lens wearers, every patient who wears contact lens should be considered potential candidate for GPC.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\n\tSaxena S, Clinical Ophthalmology: Medical and Surgical Approach.

This leads to conjunctivitis and further tissue changes and increasing inflammatory markers in the tears.\n\n\tDebris on the surface of contact lenses may be a cause as well as a result, leading to inflammation that causes more lens deposits to form, leading to further inflammation.\n\n\tPoor cleaning, thick or rough contact lens edges, heat sterilisation and extended wearing time favour the development of giant papillary conjunctivitis.\n\n\tFirst-generation silicone hydro-gel contact lenses may be more prone to GPC development, perhaps because of their mechanical stiffness or higher propensity for lipid deposition. Silicone hydro-gel lenses tend to induce more local GPC, whereas soft (hydro-gel) lenses tend to induce more generalised GPC reactions in upper palpebral conjunctiva.\n\nAntigenic factors:\n\n\tIn patients with GPC, there is increase in numbers of inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, plasma cells eosinophils and basophils in conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria. These findings, along with elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also found to be elevated in the tears of GPC patients, with the degree of elevation correlated to the severity of symptoms. With discontinuation of lens wear and resolution of the signs and symptoms, these tear immunoglobulin levels return to normal.\n\n\tThe proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. Even with the best cleaning regimens involving enzymatic treatment, a residual coating still exists, and as new coating material is constantly built on the surface of the lens, the overall lens coating increases. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.\n\n\tThe nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. However, those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposit on GPC-associated contact lenses.\n\nMechanical hypothesis: \n\n\tMechanical hypothesis, is supported by the association between GPC and inert objects, such as cyanoacrylate adhesives, exposed sutures and scleral buckle elements, ocular dermoids and orbital prosthesis. It is postulated that the irritation produced by lens damages conjunctival epithelial cells, and causes release of chemotactic factors (e.g. neutrophil chemotactic factor). It is suggested that a combination of direct trauma and the resulting inflammation cascade can stimulate a hypersensitivity reaction to lens-bound antigens.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of GPC is generally made by thorough history and careful clinical observation.\n\n\tGPC shares morphologic and histologic similarities with VKC, but is best differentiated from this and other immunologically based conjunctival inflammation by the associated clinical history (e.g. contact lens wear, surgical intervention).\n\n\tA careful and selective history is necessary to elicit the reports of symptoms that many may consider normal discomfort associated with contact lens use.\n\n\tA history of systemic allergy also help to predict which of the contact lens users may end up with GPC.\n\n\tSlit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist is required for the diagnosis.\n\n\tThe bio-microscopic finding of normal tarsal conjunctiva, include a vascular arcade of fine, radiating vessels running perpendicular to the lid margin and a smooth, moist and pink surface. This has been termed a \u2018satin\u2019 appearance. Generally, the surface is devoid of papillae, or there may be a fine, fairly uniform papillary appearance detectable after the instillation of fluorescein dye and examination with cobalt-blue filter. These papillae, if present, are often smaller than 0.3 mm in size. Non-specific signs of inflammation, such as thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva with mild hyperaemia, may be noted in early cases. In addition, bulbar conjunctival injection, superior corneal pannus, and corneal opacities may also be found on examination. As the disease progresses, non-uniform papillary changes develop, and finally giant papillae are seen, defined as a papillary reaction greater than 0.3 mm.\n\n\tAllansmith divided superior tarsal surface into three zones. Zone 1 is located proximally along the uppermost edge of tarsal plate, zone 3 is located distally adjacent to the lid margin, with zone 2 in between. Papillae associated with soft contact lens-related GPC first appear in zone 1 and progress to zone 2 and 3.This pattern is reversed in GPC related to rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens wear. Papillae associated with RGP contact lenses are typically seen in zone 3, adjacent to the lid margin or distal half of the lid. These papillae are usually fewer in number and flattened in appearance. The topographic difference between GPC associated with large diameter soft contact lenses and small diameter RGP lenses is most probably related to mechanical or immunological stimulus for GPC. The conjunctiva is affected in sequential manner as the disease progresses. In the early stages, there is hyperaemia of the conjunctiva, with partial loss of the vascular pattern of conjunctiva. The papillae size is around 0.3mm. With progression of the disease there is more congestion of the tarsal surface with loss of vascular pattern. In severe cases, the tarsal plate is thickened with total obscuration of the vascular pattern. This stage may be associated with sub-conjunctival scarring.\n\n\tCharacterisation of the size and location of the papillae is helpful in correlating clinical findings with patient symptoms. Delineation of the upper tarsal plate into three zones, as well as two areas medially and laterally, can be useful to the clinician in determining whether findings are within the normal variance or whether it represents disease. For example, large papillae in the junctional or transitional zone are not considered pathologic and should be disregarded in the assessment of the upper tarsal conjunctiva.\n\n\tBio-microscopic findings may also be helpful, as the location and appearance of the papillae are associated with the type and material of the lens. Soft contact lens wearers often exhibit a generalised papillary response, whereas those wearing rigid gas-permeable lenses or silicone hydro-gels manifest papillae in a more localised fashion. Soft lens wearers usually form papillae nearest the upper margin of the tarsal plate and progress to diffuse involvement, whereas rigid lens wearers and those using silicone hydro-gel lenses develop papillae near the lid margin and persist in a more localised pattern.\n\n\tIn addition, other associated signs and symptoms can aid in the diagnosis of GPC. These signs and symptoms are often classified into four stages:\n\nStage 1, or Preclinical disease: Minimal mucous discharge is usually noted upon awakening, and patients may have occasional itching after lens removal. Examination of the lens reveals a mild protein coating. The tarsal conjunctiva may appear normal, or exhibit mild hyperaemia with normal vascular structures.\n\nStage 2, or Mild disease: \u00a0There is increased mucous production along with itching, increased lens awareness and marked coating of the contact lens. Blurring of vision may occur. Mild to moderate injection of the tarsal conjunctiva is seen with some loss of normal vascular pattern (i.e. superficial vessels are typically obscured, but deeper vessels are still visible). The papillary reaction noted on examination may show variability in terms of the size of the papillae. Some of the papillae measure 0.3 mm or greater at this stage, and can best be detected upon examination with cobalt-blue filter after instillation of fluorescein dye.\n\nStage 3, or Moderate disease: Itching and mucous formation, along with lens coating, are more prominent, and patients often have difficulty with lens tolerance and keeping the lens clean. Increased lens awareness and excessive lens movement with blinking results in fluctuating vision and reduction in lens wear time. The tarsal conjunctiva shows marked thickening and injection, with obscuration of normal vascular pattern. The papillae increases in both size and number, and the papillae appear more elevated secondary to changes in the underlying tissue (e.g. sub-conjunctival fibrosis and thickening).\n\nStage 4, or severe disease: Patients are often unable to wear their lenses at all, with intense discomfort and cloudy vision upon initial insertion of the lens. There is excessive lens movement and poor centration of the contact lens. Increased mucous secretion is also seen, often to the point where the eyelids are stuck together in the morning. The normal vascular pattern is completely obscured, and the papillae have enlarged to size of 1 mm or greater. There may be sub-conjunctival scarring and fluorescein staining of the apices of papillae.\n\n\tIt is important to note that, although these stages can aid in the characterisation of the disease, patient presentation is often variable. Some patients may have minimal complaints but exhibit marked inflammatory changes on the tarsal conjunctiva; in contrast, patients with severe symptoms may present with only mild or early tarsal changes. Also, despite GPC is often noted bilaterally, the clinical findings may be grossly asymmetric. In some cases, the disparity between eyes is easily explained (e.g. poor lens fit), but in other cases, no specific reason is determined.\n\nThus signs of GPC are:\n\n\t- Increased mucous discharge. Increased mucous discharge in GPC is because of increased surface area and thickness of epithelium with a resultant increase in total number of goblet cells. There is also increased mucous secretion by non-goblet epithelial cells.\n\n\t- Substantial CL protein deposits may be present.\n\n\t- Excessive CL mobility due to upper lid capture.\n\n\t- Superior tarsal hyperaemia and papillae; by definition, \u2018giant\u2019 papillae are > 1.0 mm in diameter, but the clinical syndrome of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis commonly features only fine/medium papillae, particularly in early or mild disease.\n\n\t- Focal apical ulceration and whitish scarring may develop on larger papillae.\n\n\t- Ptosis may occur, mainly as a result of irritative spasm and tissue laxity secondary to chronic inflammation.\n\n\tThe pathognomonic sign of disease is papillae formation on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Presence of papillae larger than 0.3 mm in association with presence of the symptoms is diagnostic of GPC.\n\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\n\n\tNeutrophils and lymphocytes are present in the epithelium and substantia propria of normal conjunctival tissue. Mast cells and plasma cells are also present, though they are sequestered to the substantia propria. In patients with GPC, these cells increase in number and are often found throughout the epithelium and the substantia propria, and are found in conjunction with other inflammatory cells, such as basophils and eosinophils. Elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also elevated in the tears of GPC patients.\n\n\tThe proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.\n\n\tThe nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. Those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposits on GPC-associated contact lenses.\n\nGPC should be differentiated from conditions such as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chlamydial genitourinary infections.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Congenital ptosis.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tOther cause of conjunctival papillae should be excluded, as well as CL intolerance due to other causes, such as a reaction to lens cleaning solutions and dry eyes.\n\n\tGPC treatment is directed at reducing or eliminating any mechanical stimulation and lens coating from the contact lenses or modulating the immune response to the antigenic proteins on the lens surface. Depending on the severity of disease, several or all of the strategies for reducing lens coating or mechanical stimulation may need to be employed.\n\n\tThe ultimate goal in managing patients with GPC is to allow them to continue wearing their contact lenses.\n\n\tIndividuals utilising daily disposable lenses have not been reported to develop GPC.\n\n\t\u00a0Removal of the stimulus:\n\n\t- Measures adopted to reduce exposure to the antigenic proteins on the contact lens:\n\n\n\t\tCL wear should be discontinued for several weeks and the current lenses replaced. For mild-moderate disease, this may be adequate for resolution. In severe CLPC a longer interval without lens wear may be needed.\n\n\t\tDecreasing the lens wear time.\n\n\t\tChanging design of the contact lens.\n\n\t\tChanging the lens material.\n\n\t\tShortening contact lens replacement interval.\n\n\n\t- Assessment of the status and fit of an ocular prosthesis.\n\n\t- Replacement of ocular prosthesis by a new prosthesis (preferably coated with bio-compatible material- biocoat).\n\n\t- Removal of other underlying causes, such as exposed sutures or a scleral buckle.\n\n\t- Partial excision, revision with non-penetrating drainage surgery or glaucoma drainage device implantation for filtering bleb.\n\n\t- Cessation of contact lens wear, substituting spectacles or refractive surgery, may be necessary for severe or refractory disease.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nEnsure effective cleaning of CL or ocular prosthesis:\n\n\t- Changing the type of CL solution, particularly discontinuation of preservative-containing preparations. Cleaning, rinsing and storage solutions containing preservatives such as thiomersal and chlorhexidine should be discarded.\n\n\t- Switching to monthly, then daily disposable CL, if the condition persists after renewing non-disposable lenses.\n\n\t- Rigid lenses carry a lesser risk of CLPC, probably because they are easier to clean effectively.\n\n\t- Regular (at least weekly) use of contact lens protein removal tablets (enzyme cleaning).\n\n\t- Ocular prosthesis: Ocular prosthesis should be cleaned with detergent and polished.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\t-\u00a0Cold compresses: Cold compresses help in improving symptoms.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tMedications such as mast cell stabilisers and topical corticosteroids may be needed to control immune reaction.\n\nDrug therapy includes:\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical artificial tears: Artificial tears provide lubrication and help to wash away the environmental allergens and lens debris.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical mast cell stabilisers: Mast cell stabilisers should be non-preserved in patients wearing soft contact lens, or can be instilled when the lenses are not in the eye, with a delay of perhaps half an hour after drop instillation prior to lens insertion. Most can be continued long-term if necessary. Examples are cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast. Cromolyn sodium in early GPC, particularly when combined with meticulous lens hygiene, gives relief of foreign body sensation, dryness, congestion, mucus production and in papillary size.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective, and thus significantly reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action. Topical antihistamine and mast cell stabiliser combination solution may offer a pharmacologic adjunctive treatment. Combined antihistamine/mast cell stabilisers generally suffice without exposing the patient to the known risks of topical corticosteroids. Most patients do not require more aggressive treatment.\n\n\t-\u00a0Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve symptoms. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical corticosteroids: Topical steroids like fluorometholone or loteprednol may be used. Topical steroids can be used for the acute phase of resistant cases, particularly those where effective removal of the stimulus is difficult, as in bleb-related disease.\n\n\tShort-term low-potency topical corticosteroid used concurrently with combined antihistamine/mast cell stabiliser (dual-acting drugs) is a more effective treatment than mono-therapy with either separately.\n\n\tThere is no role of long-term usage of topical steroids in treatment due to associated complications (development of cataract, glaucoma or superadded infections).\n\n\t-\u00a0Immune-modulator drugs: Immune-modulator drug such as tacrolimus ointment is found to be comparable to fluorometholone in efficacy without the side effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of GPC. (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/22821643).\n\n\tTopical tacrolimus ointment for severe GPC cases, refractory to conventional therapy, appears to be effective alternative treatment (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/18216583).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tImmune response modulation for GPC mainly focuses on topical therapy, most commonly mast cell stabilisers and loteprednol. Mast cell stabilisers may be used in patients with moderate to severe GPC that suffered a recurrence of symptoms despite changes in the contact lens design or polymer. The use of steroids, such as loteprednol, has been found to reduce the presence of papillae, itching, and lens intolerance. However, chronic treatment with a steroid is generally not recommended in these cases.\n\n\tA combination of the two options seems most appropriate for initiating treatment for the patient suffering from GPC.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nFor stage 1, more frequent observation (e.g. 4-6 month follow-up) may be all that is required, as these individuals are generally asymptomatic but will be predisposed to developing GPC.\n\n\tTreatment for stage 2 to stage 3 should begin with discontinuation of contact lenses for about 2-4 weeks, with re-evaluation of the conjunctiva and refit with frequent replacement of contact lenses. These can range from daily disposables lenses to lenses that are replaced every 2 weeks. For those changing their lenses every 1-2 weeks, a lens cleaning regimen utilising a hydrogen peroxide (disinfection by hydrogen peroxide appears to be least likely to further traumatise the conjunctiva)based cleaner is preferred. If there is return of symptoms despite a change in the lens type and polymer, discontinue the lenses for another 2-4 weeks, refit with a daily disposable lens (or RGP lens) and add a mast cell stabiliser. These patients should generally be re-evaluated 3-4 times in a year.\n\nFor severe, or stage 4 disease, discontinuation of contact lens wear may be required for at least 4 weeks, along with refitting the contact lens with either a daily disposable or RGP lens. Check for the resolution of associated findings of corneal and apical papillary staining. The appearance and size of the papillae may not change during the course of treatment for severe GPC. If the associated inflammatory signs have resolved, then attempts to refit the patient with a new lens may have a greater success rate. If the patient is refitted with a daily wear contact lens and replaces the lens in an interval of 4 weeks or less, the rate of developing GPC reduces.\n\n\tIf there is no response and signs and symptoms persist, one may have to consider discontinuing contact lens use.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\t-\u00a0Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) may be considered in patients who refuse conservative management. This helps in avoiding contact lenses.\n\nTherapeutic effect is evidenced by:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Return of contact lens tolerance.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased mucous in tears.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suppression of ocular itching.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased hyperaemia of tarsal conjunctiva.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased inflammation of giant papillae.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tAmelioration of symptoms is more important than clinical signs in assessment of therapeutic effect.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tOverall prognosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is good. About 80% of patients may return to comfortable contact lens wear with appropriate management.\n\n\tGiant papillary conjunctivitis has been a common cause of temporary and permanent contact lens intolerance.\n\n\tThe eyelids in some patients may return to their normal appearance following resolution of GPC, whereas in others, lid retain small, white-capped scars of giant papillae for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.\n\n\tPatients should be educated about the chronic nature of disease and its clinical symptoms (e.g. Itching of eyes, mucous discharge and contact lens intolerance). Patient should be advised to present within a week of any relapsing symptoms.

 {"id":132, "name":"Kala-azar/ Leishmaniasis", "intro":"Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation (swelling) of the liver. It can be caused due to viral infection or when liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads to\u00a0jaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise. Hepatitis is of 2 types: acute and chronic.\n\n\tAcute hepatitis occurs when it lasts for less than six months and\u00a0chronic if it persists for longer duration.\n\n\tA group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses most commonly \u00a0\u00a0cause the disease, but hepatitis can also be caused by toxic substances (notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic solvents and plants), other infections and autoimmune diseases.\n\nTypes of hepatitis: The most common types of hepatitis are described below:\n\nHepatitis A:\u00a0Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It is the most common type of viral hepatitis. It is generally seen in the areas where sanitation and sewage disposal are poor. This disease is commonly spread through fecal-oral route (ingestion of contaminated food and water). It is usually a short-term (acute) infection and its symptoms pass away within three months. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A other than using medication, such as the painkiller ibuprofen, to relieve symptoms. A vaccination can protect against hepatitis A. Vaccination is recommended if a person is travelling to countries where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and Eastern Europe.\n\nHepatitis B:\u00a0Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. This can be found in blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, so it \u00a0generally spread during unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs. Hepatitis B is commonly seen in drug users. It is common in India and other parts of the world, such as China, Central and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most people infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. The infection can be unpleasant to live with, but usually causes no lasting harm. However, a small minority of people may develop long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B. A vaccination is available for hepatitis B, which is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users.\n\nHepatitis C:\u00a0Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus. This can be found in the blood and to a much lesser extentin the saliva, \u00a0semen or vaginal fluid of an infected person. It is particularly concentrated in the blood, so it is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or causes symptoms that are mistaken for the flu, therefore so many people are unaware if they are infected. Many people fight off the infection and will be free of the virus. In the remaining the virus might stay in their body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated by taking antiviral medications, although there can be some unpleasant side effects. There is currently no vaccination for hepatitis C.\n\nAlcoholic hepatitis:\u00a0Drinking excessive amount of alcohol over the course of many years can damage the liver, leading to hepatitis. This type of hepatitis is known as alcoholic hepatitis. It is estimated that heavy drinkers has some degree of alcoholic hepatitis. The condition does not usually cause any symptoms and is often detected with a blood test. If a person with alcoholic hepatitis continues to drink alcohol, there is a real risk that \u00a0\u00a0he \u00a0may develop cirrhosis and possibly liver failure.\n\nOther types of hepatitis\n\nHepatitis D:\u00a0Hepatitis D, caused by the hepatitis D virus, is only present in people already infected with hepatitis B (it needs the presence of the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in \u00a0the body).\n\nHepatitis E:\u00a0Hepatitis E, caused by the hepatitis E virus, is \u00a0\u00a0generally a mild and short-term infection. It also spreads through fecal-oral route. Person-to-person transmission is rare.\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis:\u00a0Autoimmune hepatitis is a very rare cause of chronic (long-term) hepatitis. The white blood cells attack the liver, causing chronic inflammation and damage. This can lead to more serious problems, such as liver failure. The reason for this reaction is unknown. Symptoms include tiredness, pains in \u00a0\u00a0abdomen, joint aches, jaundice (yellow tinge to your skin and whites of \u00a0\u00a0eyes) and cirrhosis. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves medicines that \u00a0\u00a0suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Steroid medication (prednisolone) can gradually reduce \u00a0swelling over several weeks, and can then be used to control \u00a0\u00a0symptoms.\n\nReferences: www.who.int\nwww.nhs.uk\nwww.cdc.gov\nwww.who.int\nwww.nlm.nih.gov", "symtoms":"Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are similar to the flu and include:\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0Muscle and joint pain\n\n\t\t\u00a0A high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above\n\n\t\t\u00a0Feeling unwell\n\n\t\t\u00a0Headache\n\n\t\t\u00a0Occasionally yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice), Symptoms of chronic hepatitis can include:\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0Feeling tired all the time\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0Depression\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0Jaundice\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0A general sense of feeling unwell\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.nhs.uk\nwww.nlm.nih.gov", "causes":"Hepatitis infection is caused by Hepatitis viruses: Type A, B, C, D, E\n\n\n\t\tHepatitis is also caused by bacterias like anaplasma, nocardia and many more\n\n\t\tOther factors like alcohol\n\n\t\tAuto immune conditions: systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n\t\tDrugs: Paracetamol, amoxycillin, antituberculosis medicines, minocycline and many others\u00a0\n\n\t\tIschemic hepatitis (circulatory insufficiency)\n\n\t\tMetabolic diseases: Wilson's disease\n\nPregnancy\n\n\nReference:\u00a0www.nhs.uk", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of hepatitis is made by biochemical assessment of liver function.\n\n\n\t\tInitial laboratory evaluation should include\u00a0bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase(AST), alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time, total protein, albumin, globulin, complete blood count and coagulation studies .\n\n\t\tHepatitis A, B,C,D, E diagnosis depends on demonstration of specific antigen and/or antibody (detected by an ELISA) in sera.\n\n\t\tLiver biopsy tests are also conducted to know the extent of liver damage\n\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.who.int\nwww.nlm.nih.gov", "management":"Bed rest, refraining from alcohol, and taking medication to relieve symptoms.\n\n\t\tMost people who have hepatitis A and E get well on their own after a few weeks.\n\n\t\tHepatitis B is treated with drugs, such as lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil.\n\n\t\tHepatitis C is treated with a combination of peginterferon and ribovarin.\n\n\t\tLiver transplant of hepatitis B or C, or D-caused liver failure\n\n\n\tThis is only an indicative information.

 {"id":139, "name":"Lagophthalmos", "intro":"Hypertension\n\n\tHypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure.\n\n\tBlood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart.\n\n\tThe higher the pressure in blood vessels the harder the heart has to work in order to pump blood. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack, an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots due to high pressure, making them more likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can also cause blood to leak out into the brain. This can cause a stroke. Hypertension can also lead to kidney failure, blindness, rupture of blood vessels and cognitive impairment.\n\n\tBlood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is recorded as two numbers usually written one above the other. The upper number is the systolic blood pressure(SBP) - the highest pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts, or beats. The lower number is the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) - the lowest pressure in blood vessels when the heart muscle relaxes.\n\n\tHypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is equal or above 140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is equal or above 90 mmHg.\n\n\tAccording to WHO estimates, 1.13 billion people worldwide have hypertension, most (two-thirds) living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\tIn nearly all high-income countries, widespread diagnosis and treatment with low-cost medication have led to a significant drop in the proportion of people with raised blood pressure as well as the average blood pressure across populations. This has contributed to a reduction in deaths from heart disease. For example, the prevalence of raised blood pressure in the WHO region of the Americas in 2014 was 18%, as compared to 31% in 1980.\n\n\tIn contrast, low-income countries have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure. In the WHO African region, about 27% of adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure. This proportion is increasing and the average blood pressure levels in this region are much higher than global averages due to rise in hypertension risk factors. The prevalence of hypertension in India is about 29.8% (in urban areas 33.8% and in rural areas 27.6%) *\n\n\tMany people with high blood pressure in developing countries are not aware of their disease. Those who are diagnosed may not have access to treatment and may not be able to successfully control their illness over the long term. It contributes to the burden of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability.\n\n\tDetection, treatment and control of hypertension is an important health priority worldwide.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences-\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension\n\nwww.who.int/topics/hypertension/en/\n\nwww.who.int/features/qa/82/en/\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/\n\n\t*Clinical Journal of Hypertension | April-September 2019 | Vol. No. 3 | Issue No. 2 & 3, accessed from\u00a0 https://hsindia.org/images/journal/2019/october_2019_special_issue.pdf", "symtoms":"Most hypertensive people have no symptoms at all; this is why it is known as the \u201csilent killer\u201d.\n\n\tSometimes hypertension causes symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations of the heart and nose bleeds.

It accounts for 90-95% of adult cases of hypertension. It has been linked to certain risk factors. It may develop as a result of environmental or genetic causes. Obesity, diabetes, and heart disease also have genetic components and contribute to hypertension.\n\nSecondary hypertension-When a direct cause for high blood pressure can be identified, the condition is described as secondary hypertension. About 2-10% of high blood pressure cases are due to an underlying condition or cause such as-\n\n\n\t\tRenal parenchymal diseases (2.5-6%),\n\n\t\tVascular causes (.2-4%),\n\n\t\tEndocrine causes (1-2%)\n\n\t\tExogenous (administration of steroids, oral contraceptive use),\n\n\t\tEndogenous (primary hyperaldosteronism, cushing syndrome, pheochromocytoma,\u00a0congenital adrenal hyperplasia),\n\n\t\tdrugs and toxins (alcohol, cocaine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAID), nicotine, decongestant containing ephedrine, herbal remedies containing licorice or ephedrine).\n\n\n\t\u00a0Other causes include pregnancy induced hypertension, Obstructive sleep apnea.\n\nRisk factors\u00a0for developing high blood pressure are-\n\nNon-modifiable risk factors-\n\n\n\t\tFamily History-High blood pressure can run in a family.\n\n\t\tAdvanced Age-Risk of high blood pressure increases with age.\n\n\t\tGender- High blood pressure is more common in young and middle aged men, while higher proportion of women suffer from hypertension late in life due to post-menopausal changes.\n\n\nModifiable risk factors-\n\n\n\t\tLack of physical activity.\n\n\t\tPoor diet- consumption of food containing too much salt and fat, and not eating enough fruits and vegetables.\n\n\t\tOverweight and obesity.\n\n\t\tHeavy and too much consumption of alcohol.\n\n\t\tPossible contributing factors- poor stress management, smoking and second hand smoke, sleep apnea.\n\n\t\tPre-hypertension (blood pressure slightly higher than normal) increases the risk of developing hypertension in the future.\n\n\t\tDiabetes mellitus-About 60% of people who have diabetes also have high blood pressure.\n\n\n\tReferences-\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/about.htm\n\nwww.cdc.gov\n\nhttps://nhm.gov.in/images/pdf/guidelines/nrhm-guidelines/stg/hypertension.pdf\n\n\tPark\u2019s Textbook of Preventive & Social Medicine, 22nd\u00a0Edition, Hypertension, 345-348\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension", "diagnosis":"All adults should know their blood pressure levels. There are different types of devices (sphygmomanometers) that are used to measure blood pressure. These are electronic, mercury and aneroid devices.\n\n\n\t\tWHO recommends the use of affordable and reliable electronic devices that have the option to select manual readings. Semi-automatic devices enable manual readings to be taken when batteries run down.\n\n\t\tIt is recommended by WHO that mercury devices should be phased out in favour of electronic devices (as mercury is a toxic material).\n\n\t\tAneroid devices as sphygmomanometers should be used only if they are calibrated every six months and users should be trained in measuring blood pressure using such devices.\n\n\n\tBlood pressure measurements need to be recorded for several days before a diagnosis of hypertension can be made. Blood pressure is recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening. Two consecutive measurements are taken, at least a minute apart and with the person seated. Measurements taken on the first day are discarded and the average value of all the remaining measurements is taken to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension.\n\n\tRoutine laboratory tests are also recommended before initiating therapy. These include an electrocardiogram; urine analysis; blood glucose and hematocrit; serum potassium, creatinine (or the corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), calcium; and a lipid profile after 9 to12 hour fast that includes high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides.\n\n\tDigital blood pressure measurement machines can be used outside clinic settings. Self-monitoring of blood pressure is recommended for the management of hypertension in patients where measurement devices are affordable and who have limited access to health services due to

to control blood pressure. For others, these changes are insufficient and they need prescription medication to control blood pressure.\n\nLifestyle measures:\n\n\n\t\tSalt restriction - reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day (typical salt intake is 9 -12 g per day)\n\n\t\tLimit intake of alcohol.\n\n\t\tHigh consumption of vegetables and fruits and low-fat diet.\n\n\t\tReducing weight and maintaining it.\n\n\t\tRegular physical exercise - hypertensive patients should participate in at least 30 min of moderate-intensity dynamic aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling or swimming) on 5 to 7 days a week.\n\n\t\tStop Smoking and use of other tobacco products.\n\n\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-The DASH eating plan requires no special foods and instead provides daily and weekly nutritional goals. This plan recommends:\n\n\n\t\tEating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\n\n\t\tIncluding fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oil\n\n\t\tLimiting foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils.\n\n\t\tLimiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets.\n\n\t\tWhen following the DASH eating plan, it is important to choose foods that are:\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLow in saturated and\u00a0trans\u00a0fats\n\n\t\t\t\tRich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber, and protein\n\n\t\t\t\tLower in sodium\n\n\n\n\nAntihypertensive Medicines- Antihypertensive drugs (drugs lowering the BP) work in several ways, such as removing excess salt and fluid from the body, slowing the heartbeat or relaxing and widening the blood vessels. Medicines to lower blood pressure include:\n\n\nDiuretics (Water or Fluid Pills):\u00a0Flush excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in blood and helps to lower your blood pressure.\n\nBeta Blockers:\u00a0Help heart to beat slower and with less force. As a result, heart pumps less blood through blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure.\n\nAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.\n\nAngiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs):\u00a0Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.\n\nCalcium Channel Blockers:\u00a0Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower blood pressure.\n\nAlpha Blockers:\u00a0Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.\n\nAlpha-Beta Blockers:\u00a0Reduce nerve impulses and also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.\n\nCentral Acting Agents:\u00a0Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.\n\nVasodilators:\u00a0Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/express.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/guidelines/\n\nwww.who.int/topics/hypertension/en/\u00a0,\n\n\tcontrol your Blood Pressure:\n\nwww.youtube.com/embed/LDWPJijPuBY\n\n\tHypertension: Screening, Diagnosis, Assessment, and Management of Primary Hypertension in Adults in India, Quick reference guide May2016, MoHFW, Government of India, accessed from\n\nhttp://clinicalestablishments.gov.in/WriteReadData/6591.pdf\n\n\tIndian Guidelines on Hypertension-IV (2019), Clinical Journal of Hypertension | April-September 2019 | Vol. No. 3 | Issue No. 2 & 3 accessed from\n\nhttps://hsindia.org/images/journal/2019/october_2019_special_issue.pdf", "complications":"When blood pressure stays high over long time, it can damage the different organs of the body and causes complications.

 {"id":140, "name":"Lead poisoning", "intro":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that is common throughout the world. HPV is one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions a. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract.\n\n\tThe main burden of HPV-related disease is due to cervical cancer. HPV infection is a well-established cause of cervical cancer and a relevant factor in other anogenital cancers (anus, vulva, vagina and penis) and head and neck cancers. HPV is also responsible for other diseases such as recurrent juvenile respiratory papillomatosis (a disease in which tumours grow in the air passages leading from the nose and mouth into the lungs) and genital warts in men and women. Genital warts are very common and highly infectious.\n\n\tCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\tAbout 80% of cancer cases attributable to HPV were in developing countries.\u00a0 The highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.\n\n\tIndia has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of ageb.\n\n\tBased on Indian studies (performing HPV detection tests in cervical samples) about 5.0% of women in the general population are found to carry cervical HPV-16/18 infection at a given time, and 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18.(Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)b.\n\n\tOther epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.\n\n\tIndia also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.\n\n\tHPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for about 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. HPV vaccines that prevent against HPV 16 and 18 infections are now available and have the potential to reduce the incidence of cervical and other anogenital cancers.\n\nReferences-\n\n\ta.nhp.gov.in/diseasesexually-transmitted-infections\n\n\tb. hpvcentre.net/statistics/reports/IND.pdf (Human Papillomavirus and Related Diseases Report, India, ICO Information Centre on HPV and Cancer (HPV Information Centre) 2015)\n\nwho.int/bulletin/volumes/85/9/06-038414/en/\n\nwho.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs380/en/\n\nwho.int/immunization/diseases/hpv/en/", "symtoms":"Most of the HPV infections cause no symptoms and subsides spontaneously by body\u2019s immune system.

Periods of extreme heat that have an effect on human health are referred as heat waves. Climate change is leading to an increase in average temperatures and increased possibilities of severe heat waves. The impact of extreme summer heat on human health may be exacerbated by increase in humidity. Heat waves are an emerging public-health problem.\n\n\tExtreme heat can lead to minor illnesses, such as heat rash (prickly heat), heat oedema, heat cramps, and tetany, as well as serious illnesses as heat syncope, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat stroke is the most severe form of the heat-related illness. The mortality rate among heat stroke victims is as high as one-third, and one-fifth of the heat stroke survivors suffer neurologic damage.\n\n\tHeat-related illnesses include:\n\n\nHeat rash (Prickly heat): small, red, papules develop in hot climate when the sweat ducts to the skin become blocked or swell, causing discomfort and itching.\n\nHeat cramps occur in muscles after exercise in hot climate because sweating causes the body to lose water, salt, and minerals (electrolytes).\n\nHeat oedema\u00a0(swelling) in the legs and hands, can occur after sitting or standing for a long time in a hot environment.\n\nHeat tetany is usually caused by short periods of stress in a hot environment.\n\nHeat syncope (fainting) occurs from low blood pressure. Heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) and body fluids move into the legs because of gravity.\n\nHeat exhaustion\u00a0(heat prostration) generally develops when a person is working or exercising in hot weather and does not drink enough liquids to replace those lost liquids.\u00a0\n\nHeat stroke (sun stroke) is a severe heat illness defined as hyperthermia with a body temperature greater than 40 \u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) with neurologic dysfunction because of environmental heat exposure with lack of\u00a0thermoregulation (process by which the body maintains a steady temperature). It is also known as sun stroke.\n\n\nHeat stroke is a medical emergency. Even with immediate treatment, it can be life-threatening or cause serious long-term problems.\n\n\tHeat- related illness is a common problem in the tropics and with ever-increasing global warming its incidence is rising even in temperate climate. The highest incidence of heat illness of 45-1300/100000 persons is reported from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\tIn India, heat stroke (HS) occurs frequently in areas of northern and western India, and sporadic cases of exertional heat stroke (EHS) are reported in military recruits. In 2015, (April-June) recorded maximum temperature was 6\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C more than the average maximum temperature (mean daily maximum temperature) which resulted in 2422 human deaths due to heat wave. States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand and Delhi are mostly affected by heat wave season.\n\n\tChildren, elderly persons, chronically ill persons, outdoor workers, pavement and slum dwellers, street venders and rickshaw pullers are at greater risk of heat related illnesses.\n\n\tGreater awareness about heat related illnesses will help in preventing, recognizing and treating these disorders at an early stage. Public education on heat illnesses, behavioural changes and restricted use of alcohol, enforced rests and fluid protocols, acclimatisation and ready availability of cooling facilities in hot areas will help in decreasing morbidity and mortality. Most heat-related illnesses can be prevented by keeping the body cool and by avoiding dehydration in hot environments.\n\nFind more information:\n\n\t\u201cGuidelines for Preparation of Action Plan \u2013 Prevention and Management of Heat-Wave\u201d, 2016 by National Disaster Management Authority, Government of India-\n\nndma.gov.in/images/guidelines\n\nReferences-\n\nndma.gov.in/images/guidelines/\n\nndma.gov.in/images/pdf/HAP2015.\n\n\tMehta SR et al, Heat Stroke, MJAFI 2003; 59: 140-143, accessed from medind.nic.in/\n\nsearo.who.int/india/topics/occupational_health/\n\neuro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/\n\nwho.int/globalchange/publications/WMO_", "symtoms":"symptoms of various heat related illnesses are-\n\n\nHeat rash (Prickly heat) - Small, red, itchy papules appear on the face, neck, upper chest, under breast, groin and scrotum areas.

Comprehensive approach should be multidisciplinary, including components from community education, social mobilization, vaccination, screening, treatment and palliative care.\n\nPrimary prevention begins with HPV vaccination of girls aged 9-13 years, before they become sexually active. Two HPV vaccines are there - a bivalent and a quadrivalent vaccine.\n\n\tThe quadrivalent vaccine gives 100% protection against infection from HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for around 70% of all cervical cancers.

Infection with EV71 can cause severe disease in children, sometimes resulting in death.\n\n\tThough the outbreaks of HFMD occur worldwide but in recent years these have occurred more in Asia including: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan (China) and Viet Nam.\n\n\tHFMD was first reported in India from Calicut (Kerala) in 2003, thereafter outbreaks were reported from Nagpur (Maharashtra), Jorhat (Assam), Kolkata (West Bengal), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Udaipur (Rajasthan), Leh (Jammu and Kashmir).\u00a0\n\n\tHFMD is not to be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which occurs in animals (cattle, sheep, and pigs) by a different virus and do not transmit to humans.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.wpro.who.int/topics/hand_foot_mouth/en/\n\nwww.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318054/\n\nwww.idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/72914162\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/July", "symtoms":"HFMD is usually a mild disease.

 {"id":143, "name":"Measles(Khasra)", "intro":"Hypermetropia (hyperopia, long-sightedness or far- sightedness) is a form of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused behind the light sensitive layer of the retina, when the eye is at rest.\n\nDonders (1864) discusses in his historical review about hypermetropia. Much of the problem was caused by confusion between the effects of presbyopia and hypermetropia on near vision.\n\n\tSmall hypermetropia may be corrected by voluntary accommodation. Even high errors of refraction may be corrected this way, but convex glasses may be required if symptoms are not relieved.\n\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive error (ametropia) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays, resulting in blurred images. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\n\n\tIn hypermetropia, the cornea is flatter or the axial length is too short. Therefore, the images do not focus by the time they reach to the retina. For clear vision, a hypermetropic eye must accommodate to increase its lenticular power to bring distant objects in focus on retina. This requires contraction of ciliary muscle, and therefore, far-sighted eye is never at rest and work even harder to see near objects clearly. Hypermetropic corrections add positive focusing power to the eye for clear vision.\n\nAccommodation: The degree of hypermetropia corrected by accommodative effort is known as facultative hypermetropia. Remaining uncorrected hypermetropia is called absolute hypermetropia. Total hypermetropia after abolishing voluntary accommodation is known as manifest hypermetropia (facultative plus absolute). With advancing age, accommodative effort cannot be sustained, and hypermetropia becomes absolute till the effort of accommodation fails to correct any hypermetropia. Thus the facultative hypermetropia becomes abolished and there remains no difference between absolute and manifest hypermetropia.\n\n\tSome of the hypermetropia is corrected by the inherent tone of the ciliary muscles and this is called latent hypermetropia. The degree of latent hypermetropia is high in young persons and becomes less with advancing age. Complete cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) can abolish latent hypermetropia. The refractive error estimated under complete cycloplegia is called total hypermetropia (manifest plus latent).\n\nReferences:\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

Small amount of refractive error in young patients is usually corrected by mild accommodative effort, without producing any symptoms.\n\nSymptomatic patients may present with:\n\nWhen hypermetropia is fully corrected: At times the hypermetropia is fully corrected (thus vision is normal) but due to sustained accommodative efforts the patient develops asthenopic symptoms.\n\n\n\t\tAsthenopia (eyestrain).\n\n\t\tFrontal or fronto-temporal headache.\n\n\t\tWatering.\n\n\t\tMild aversion to light.\n\n\n\tThese symptoms worsen as the day progresses and are aggravated by prolonged near work.\n\nWhen hypermetropia is not fully corrected: When hypermetropia is not fully corrected by the voluntary accommodative efforts, then the patient complains of defective vision more for near than distance, due to sustained accommodative effort. Patient present with:\n\n\n\t\tAsthenopia.\n\n\t\tDefective vision more for near.\n\n\nWhen hypermetropia is high: When hypermetropia is high (more than 4 D), the patients usually do not accommodate and they suffer with:\n\n\n\t\tMarked defective vision for both near and distance.\n\n\nWhen there is more of absolute hypermetropia: With ageing the eye move from latent and facultative hypermetropia to greater degrees of absolute hypermetropia. This leads to progressive defective vision. Patient present with:\n\n\n\t\tBlurring of vision at a younger age than in emmetrope.\n\n\nWhen there is Spasm of accommodation: Spasm of accommodation may induce pseudo-myopia. It may be detected by cycloplegic refraction. It presents as:\n\n\n\t\tIntermittent sudden blurring of vision.\n\n\n\tIn general, child may also present with lid diseases (like blepharitis, stye or chalazion), convergent squint or amblyopia.", "causes":"Hypermetropia may be:\n\n\nAxial hypermetropia: Axial hypermetropia is the commonest type. The total refractive power of the eye is normal but there is axial shortening of the eyeball. About 1 mm shortening of the antero-posterior length of the eye results in about 3 Dioptres (D) of hypermetropia.\n\nCurvature hypermetropia: Curvature hypermetropia is that condition in which curvature of the cornea, lens or both is increased (flatter) than the normal, resulting in change in refractive power of the eye. About 1 mm increase in radius of curvature results in 6 D of hypermetropia.\n\nIndex Hypermetropia: Index Hypermetropia occurs due to change in refractive index of the crystalline lens with age.\n\nPositional hypermetropia: Positional hypermetropia results from posteriorly placed crystalline lens of the eye.\n\nAbsence of crystalline lens: Absence of crystalline lens either congenital absence or acquired (following surgical removal or posterior displacement) leads to aphakia. There is high hypermetropia in aphakia.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tIt may also be functional, as is seen in presbyopia or may be induced by cycloplegic drugs.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of hypermetropia is based on the symptoms and clinical signs observed.\n\nClinical signs:\n\n\nVisual acuity: Visual acuity varies with degree of hypermetropia and power of accommodation. Patients with low degree of refractive error may have normal visual acuity. However, there is decrease in visual acuity for seeing near objects.\n\nCover test: Cover test reveals an accommodative convergent squint. Due to altered accommodative convergence (AC) and accommodation (A) balance (AC/A ratio), maintaining binocular vision becomes difficult. The advantages of binocular vision are sacrificed in favour of more obvious advantages of clear vision. The better eye dominates for vision and the other eye develops accommodative convergent squint.\n\nEyelids: One may develop blepharitis, stye or chalazion. The correlation between lid conditions and hypermetropia is not clear.\n\nEyeball: Size of the eyeball may be normal or small.\n\nCornea: Cornea may also be slightly smaller in size. There may be associated condition of cornea plana (flat cornea).\n\nAnterior chamber: Anterior chamber is relatively shallow in high hypermetropia.\n\nGlaucoma: The eye is small in high hypermetropia along with small size of cornea and shallow anterior chamber. Due to increase in size of the lens with ageing, the eye becomes prone to an attack of narrow angle closure glaucoma.\n\nLens: Lens may be dislocated backwards.\n\nFundus: Fundus examination shows small optic disc which may look hyperaemic (vascular) with ill- defined margins. This appearance may simulate papillitis. Since there is no swelling of the disc, it is called pseudo-papillitis. The retina is shiny due to reflection of light, called as shot silk appearance. Reflex of retinal vessels may be accentuated simulating arteriosclerotic changes. Vessels may be tortuous and may show abnormal branching.\n\nUltrasonography or biometry: A- scan ultrasonography or biometry may show decreased antero- posterior length of the eyeball.\n\n\nSeverity of hypermetropia:\n\n\tBased on severity, hypermetropia may be classified as:\n\n\nLow: Up to + 2 D.\n\nModerate: From + 2.25 to 5 D.\n\nHigh: More than + 5 D, and rarely it exceeds 6 \u2013 7 D, which is equivalent to 2 mm shortening of the optic axis. Individual cases of much higher degrees (e.g. up to 24 D), without any other associated anomaly have been recorded.\n\n\nClinical types of hypermetropia:\n\nI. Simple hypermetropia: Simple hypermetropia is the commonest type. It includes axial and curvature hypermetropia due to biological variations in the development of the eye. It may be hereditary.\n\nII. Pathological hypermetropia: Pathological type is due to congenital or acquired conditions outside the normal biological variation of development. It may be\n\n\nSenile or acquired hypermetropia: It occurs in old age due to\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Curvature hypermetropia: There is decreased curvature of the outer lens fibres with ageing.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Index hypermetropia: It is due to acquired sclerosis of the cortex (outer part) of crystalline lens. In young age, refraction of the cortex is less than nucleus (central part) of the lens. This inequality results in formation of a central lens surrounded by two converging menisci. This increases the refracting power of the lens. With ageing, this differentiation diminishes and the lens becomes more homogeneous with reduced converging power.\n\n\nPositional hypermetropia: It may occur due to posterior subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens.\n\nAphakic hypermetropia: Aphakia is the displacement of the lens from its normal pupillary position in the eye. It may be congenital or acquired condition. The eye is hypermetropic with marked defective vision for near and distance. On an average there is need of + 10 or + 11 D lens for correction.\n\nConsecutive hypermetropia: It is due to surgically overcorrected myopia or pseudo-phakia (eye with intraocular lens following removal of crystalline lens as in cataract surgery) with under-correction.\n\n\nIII. Functional hypermetropia: It results from paralysis of accommodation as is seen in patients with third intracranial nerve palsy and internal ophthalmoplegia.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical optical therapy:\n\nAssessment of Vision:\n\n\tThe most common component of assessment of visual function is to test central vision through visual acuity. Visual acuity determines ability to read symbols of varying sizes at a standard testing distance. This reference distance approximates optical infinity and is typically 6 meters. A 6/6 letter on the standard eye chart devised by Snellen is considered normal visual acuity. Refractive errors may result in uncorrected visual acuities that fall below 6/6. In the absence of other diseases, the condition of hypermetropia may be corrected with restoration of normal visual function. This may be achieved with spectacles or contact lenses.\n\n\tBasic principle of therapy is to converge and focus the light rays on the retina with the help of convex (plus) glasses.\n\n\tRules for prescribing glasses in hypermetropia:\n\n\nCycloplegia: Total hypermetropia is determined by performing refraction (checking power of glasses) under complete cycloplegia.\n\nSmall total manifest hypermetropia: For small total manifest hypermetropia e.g. 1 D or less, correction may be required only if the patient is symptomatic.\n\nSpherical power: Spherical power is prescribed to the extent that it is suitably acceptable to the patient.\n\nAstigmatism: Astigmatism should be fully corrected.\n\nChildren younger than 4 years: Children younger than 4 years requiring hypermetropic correction may usually accept full cycloplegic correction. It may be reduced in older children.\n\nOlder children: Older children may not accept full cycloplegic correction because of the blur for distance. It may be increased gradually till the child accepts for the manifest hypermetropia.\n\nExophoria: Hypermetropia should be under-corrected by about 1- 2 D if there is associated exophoria.\n\nAccommodative convergent squint: Full cycloplegic correction should be given if there is accommodative convergent squint.\n\nAmblyopia (lazy eye): In the presence of associated amblyopia (Functionally reduced vision not correctable with glasses and is not due to any eye disease) in one eye, full correction with occlusion therapy should be given.\n\nGrowth of child: Hypermetropia decreases with growth of the child. Periodic refraction should be conducted and the correction should be reduced accordingly.\n\n\nPrescription of convex power:\n\n\nSpectacles: Convex lenses may be prescribed as spectacles.\n\nContact lenses: Contact lenses may be prescribed for cosmetic reasons once the refractive power of the eye stabilises. Contact lenses may be prescribed for unilateral hypermetropia as well.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tIt may be\n\n\nNon- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty: Non- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty is suitable for hypermetropia of about + 1 D to + 2.5 D. With this, multiple radially distributed spots are produced in the para-central cornea, which leads to shrinkage of the collagen in the mid- peripheral stroma and consequent steepening of the central cornea.\n\nHypermetropic photorefractive keratectomy (H- PRK): The principle of this procedure is to steepen the anterior corneal curvature. The cornea is sculpted in to a steeper convex lens by creating a furrow- like ring zone in the corneal periphery.\n\nConductive keratoplasty: Conductive keratoplasty is a non-invasive procedure in which radiofrequency is used to correct low hypermetropia with or without astigmatism. It may also be used to correct residual refractive error after cataract surgery or laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis.\n\nHypermetropic laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis (LASIK): It is used to correct mild- to- moderate hypermetropia varying from + 1 D to + 4 D.\n\nPhakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants: Phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants are used to correct higher degrees of hypermetropia, varying from about + 4 D to + 10 D. Phakic IOLs are especially designed, foldable, convex, thin lenses implanted in the posterior chamber behind the iris and in front of the normal crystalline lens.\n\nRefractive lens exchange: Extraction of clear lens with implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL. In piggyback IOL, two IOLs are placed in the eye one on top of the other. This is done if the biometry is + 40 D or so, and one does not have a lens of high power to implant.

 {"id":144, "name":"Malaria", "intro":"Heterophoria or latent squint is defined as a condition in which eyes in the primary position or in their movement are maintained on the fixation point under stress only, with the aid of corrective fusion reflexes. When the influence of fusion is removed, the visual axis of one eye deviates.\n\nOrthophoria is characterised by perfect alignment of two eyes in all positions of gaze and at all fixation distances so that the visual axes are parallel for distance and have proper convergence for near. Orthophoria as such is a rarity. A small amount of heterophoria is usually present.\n\nGeorge T Stevens (1886) introduced the term heterophoria and defined it as an abnormal adjustment of the eye muscles, or a tending of the visual lines in some other direction than parallelism, which applies to strabismus as well. In heterophoria binocular vision is habitually maintained, but by the expenditure of a greater amount of force than is demanded in the perfect equilibrium of the ocular muscles. Thus, deviation is kept latent by the fusion mechanism. In strabismus, diplopia is present and to overcome this, there is long suppression of one image. Therefore, the dividing line between heterophoria and strabismus rests on the ability or failure to maintain binocular vision.\n\n\tThe term heterophoria is derived from a Greek word, heteros meaning other, different from; and phoria meaning bringing, comparing.\n\n\tAll the anomalies of ocular alignment are divided into two classes\n\n\n\t\tLatent deviation.\n\n\t\tManifest deviation.\n\n\n\tIn heterophoria there is relative deviation of the visual axis held in check by a fusion mechanism and when this mechanism is disrupted the phoria breaks into tropia (squint) and thus the deviation becomes manifest.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

Exophoria is more often seen in elderly group.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Convergence: Excessive use of convergence may cause esophoria as is seen in bilateral congenital myopes. Decreased use of convergence leads to exophoria as is present in presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accommodation: Increased accommodation leads to esophoria as is seen in hypermetropia (far-sightedness) and also in individuals doing excessive near work. Decreased accommodation is associated with exophoria as is seen in simple myopia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dissociation factors: Prolonged constant use of one eye may result in exophoria. This is seen in people using uniocular microscope and in watchmakers using uniocular magnifying glass.\n\n\nNeurogenic causes: Lower motor neuron disease leads to incomitant heterophoria (deviations which vary with the direction of gaze) and upper motor neuron disease leads to comitant heterophoria (deviations are same in all directions of gaze for a particular fixation distance).\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nRisk factors for de-compensated heterophoria include\n\n\n\t\tGeneral debility and lowered vitality.\n\n\t\tMental stress.\n\n\t\tInadequacy of fusion reserve.\n\n\t\tAdvancing age.\n\n\t\tPrecision jobs.\n\n\n\tSensorial adaptations such as abnormal retinal correspondence and suppression of image may develop to avoid foveal diplopia. Intermittent heterotropia is heterophoria breaking into heterotropia. In this, patient sometimes has heterophoria and sometimes heterotropia.", "diagnosis":"There are different methods for diagnosis of heterophorias. There is no reason to believe that heterophorias are of smaller magnitude as compared to heterotropia. Heterophoria may be as large as 25\u02da and heterotropia may be as small as 5\u02da (microtropia). Nature of deviation depends upon the degree of fusion amplitude.\n\n\tExamination of patient comprises of detailed history and determination of refractive error (retinoscopy) under cycloplegia. Ocular movements should also be tested in all positions of gaze. Important tests in the evaluation of heterophoria include\n\n\nCover- Uncover test: It should be performed for both distance and near. One eye of the patient is covered while fixating with other eye at a distant target. The eye is then uncovered and any movement of the eye to take up fixation is noted. The test is repeated with other eye. The direction of deviation, the degree of deviation and speed of recovery is noted. If the right eye is deviated while under cover, a re-fixation movement (recovery to BSV) is observed on being uncovered. Adduction of the right eye indicates exophoria and abduction esophoria. Upward or downward movement indicates a vertical phoria. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery indicates the strength of motor fusion.\n\nAlternate cover test: The alternate cover test induces dissociation to reveal total deviation when fusion is disrupted. It is performed after cover-uncover test. The occluder is shifted quickly back and forth from one eye to other, several times. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery is noted as the eyes return to their pre- dissociated state. A patient with well compensated heterophoria will have straight eyes before and after the test has been performed, whereas a patient with poor control may decompensate to manifest deviation.\n\nMaddox rod test: The Maddox rod consists of a series of fused cylindrical red glass rods that convert the appearance of a white spot of light in to a red streak. The optical property of rod causes the streak of light to be at an angle of 90\u02da with the long axis of the rods. The Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye and patient fixates with both eyes on a spot of light. The patient is asked whether the streak produced by Maddox rod passes through the fixation light seen by the other eye. When rod is placed horizontally, a vertical streak is produced and it gives an idea about exophoria or esophoria. But a vertically placed rod produce horizontal streak, and it delineates hyper- or hypophoria. Prisms may be inserted in front of one eye to make the streak pass through the point of fixation, which estimates the degree of error. Maddox tangent scale placed at one meter or five meters may be used to measure degree of heterophoria directly from the scale.\n\nMaddox wing test: This is used to measure degree of heterophoria at near fixation. The instrument is constructed in such a way that the right eye sees only a white vertical arrow and a red horizontal arrow, whereas the left eye sees only horizontal and vertical rows of numbers. Patient rests the front piece of Maddox wing on nose and looks through the slit in eyepieces. Right eye of patient sees white scale and the left eye sees arrow. The number on scale through which white arrow passes, gives the measurement of horizontal heterophoria. Similarly, reading on vertical scale measures vertical phorias. Cyclophoria may be found by adjusting shaft of red arrow parallel to the horizontal scale.\n\nSynoptophore: This may also be used to measure degree of heterophoria.\n\nNear point of convergence: The near point of convergence is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain binocular fixation. It may be measured with royal air force (RAF) rule, which rests on cheeks of patient. A target is slowly moved along the rule towards the eyes of patient until one eye loses fixation and drifts laterally. The subjective near point of convergence is the point at which the patient reports diplopia. Normally, the near point of convergence should be nearer than 10 centimeter without undue effort.\n\nNear point of accommodation: The near point of accommodation is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain clear focus. It may also be measured with the RAF rule. The patient fixates a line of print, which is then slowly moved towards the patient until it becomes blurred. The distance at which blurring is reported first is read off the rule and it denotes the near point of accommodation. The near point of accommodation recedes with age. When near point of accommodation recedes sufficiently far away to render reading difficult without optical correction, presbyopia is present.\n\nMeasurement of fusion reserves: Fusion amplitudes measure the efficacy of vergence movements. These may be tested with prisms bars or the synoptophore. An increasingly strong prism is placed in front of one eye, which then abduct or adduct (depending on whether the prism is base-in or base-out), in order to maintain bifoveal fixation. When a prism of greater than fusion amplitude is reached, diplopia occurs or one eye drifts in the opposite direction, indicating the limit of vergence ability.\n\nAssessment of binocular vision.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClinical types of heterophoria: These are\n\n\nExophoria: It is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to diverge, which is checked by fusion amplitudes. It is a passive process unlike esophoria (which is an active process). An exophoria of less than 9 prism dioptres is usually not significant. There are three types of exophoria\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Divergence excess type.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic type.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Convergence weakness type.\n\n\nEsophoria: It is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate inwards, which is held in check by fusion impulses. It is either due to hypermetropic refractive error or high accommodative convergence/ accommodation (AC/A) ratio or increased amount of near work. There are three types of esophorias.\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Convergence excess type.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basic type.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Divergence weakness type.\n\n\nHyperphoria: Hyperphoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate upwards in a vertical direction, which is held in check by fusion amplitudes.\n\nHypophoria: Hypophoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate downwards in a vertical direction, which is held in check by fusion amplitudes.\n\nCyclophoria: Cyclophoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to rotate around their sagittal axis (antero-posterior), which is held in check by fusion amplitudes. This can be\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Incyclophoria: Incyclophoria is characterised by inward rotation of the upper pole of the cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Excyclophoria: Excyclophoria is characterised by outward rotation of the upper pole of the cornea.\n\n\nAnisophoria: Anisophoria is that type of heterophoria in which the degree of muscular imbalance varies with the direction of conjugate gaze.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\tHeterophoria should be differentiated from heterotropias.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tManagement is indicated for decompensated heterophoria. Lesser degrees of heterophoria without any symptoms require no treatment except for correction of refractive error, if present.\n\nMedical therapy\n\nI. Optical: \n\n\nEsophoria: \n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Full correction of the refractive error is given to the patient when refraction shows significant amount of hypermetropia (+1.25 dioptres or more).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Patients with high AC/A ratio and a symptomatic esophoria without hypermetropia may be treated with miotics or bifocal glasses.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Base-out prisms for visual comfort in patients with non-accommodative esophoria. To prevent total inactivity of fusion divergence mechanism, one-half to one-third only of the angle of deviation is corrected. This does not correct underlying cause of latent deviation. It is used mainly in elderly patients with symptomatic esophoria who do not respond to orthoptic treatment. It may also be used in younger patients prior to surgery.\n\n\nExophoria:\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Patients without asthenopia do not require any treatment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Significant refractive errors, especially anisometropia, aniseikonia, aphakia, intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia), and astigmatism, should be treated to produce sharp retinal images which increase stimulus to fuse. Hypermetropia of less than 2 Dioptres may be left uncorrected in children, though in older patients this needs to be corrected to avoid asthenopia. Presbyopia patients are given the weakest bifocal lenses which provide comfortable near vision. Half of exodeviation may be treated with base-in prisms for near vision. Myopic errors are fully corrected.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Minus lenses may decrease exodeviation in patients with high AC/A ratio.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In younger children with convergence insufficiency exodeviation, minus lenses as lower segment bifocals may be tried, as a temporary measure. In divergence excess exodeviation, minus lenses as upper segment bifocals may be tried.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prisms may be used for postoperative overcorrection of exodeviation. It is sometimes used preoperatively to enforce bifoveal stimulation.\n\n\nHyperphoria:\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prisms in glasses may also be tried in selective cases of hyperphoria. The prism is prescribed with the apex toward the direction of hyperphoria to correct one-half or at the most two-third of heterophoria only.\n\nII. Orthoptics:\n\n\tThis is the mainstay of treatment. Patients with moderate degrees of exophoria or esophoria who have fair degree of binocular function, orthoptic execises are the treatment of choice. Patients with convergence insufficiency are given convergence exercises on synoptophore. Likewise, patient with divergence insufficiency are given divergence exercises.\n\nIII. Miotic drugs:\n\n\tMiotic drugs may be useful in near esophoria due to high AC/A ratio. These facilitate peripheral accommodation so that less than normal innervation is required and consequently less than normal accommodative convergence occurs.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tThis is indicated in patients with intermittent exotropia who show signs of worsening in the form of\n\n\n\t\tExotropia lasts for more than 50% of the waking hours.\n\n\t\tThere are symptoms of asthenopia or diplopia.\n\n\t\tPatient develops abnormal retinal correspondence or suppression.\n\n\t\tThere is decrease in stereo-acuity.\n\n\t\tThere is development of secondary convergence insufficiency.\n\n\t\tThere is increase in deviation.\n\n\n\tThe aim of surgical procedure is to strengthen the weak muscle or to weaken the strong muscle. Elderly patients should be treated conservatively due to decreased fusion capacity. Younger patients with small surgical overcorrection may be easily treated by fusion convergence since the fusion capacity is good.\n\n\tSurgical procedures which may be performed are\n\n\nBi-medial recession: Bi-medial recession is done in cases of convergence excess.\n\nBilateral resection: Bilateral resection is done in cases of divergence insufficiency.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Symptoms generally develop with the time. It generally involves the innermost lining of large intestine (colon) and rectum. It occurs only through continuous stretches of colon.\n\nCrohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation along the lining of the digestive tract, and generally spreads deep into affected tissues. This can cause abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea and even malnutrition. The inflammation due to Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people.\n\nCollagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis\u00a0 are also considered inflammatory bowel diseases, but are usually regarded separately from classic inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.cdc.gov\nwww.nhs.uk\nwww.uhs.nhs.uk\nwww.nlm.nih.gov", "symtoms":"The main symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis are similar.\n\n\tThey include:\n\n\n\t\tAbdominal pain \u2013 \u00a0seen commonly in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis\n\n\t\tChange in bowel habits- urgent or bloody diarrhoea or sometimes constipation\n\n\t\tWeight loss\n\n\t\tExtreme tiredness\n\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.nhs.uk\nwww.uhs.nhs.uk", "causes":"The exact causes of Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis are not clear.\n\nGenetic: IBD is a disease related to genetic causes and is also subjected to selective pressures, there is a strong relation between defense and autoimmunity, suggesting a key role for maintaining the genetic relationship between inflammation and infection.", "diagnosis":"Following tests and procedures are used to diagnosis:\n\n\nBlood tests:\u00a0Blood tests are generally done to know the presence of certain antibodies. Antibodies can sometimes help to diagnose \u00a0\u00a0type of inflammatory bowel disease, but these tests can't definitely make the diagnosis.\n\nColonoscopy:\u00a0This \u00a0procedure allows to view the inside of the entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with an attached camera. During the procedure, small samples of tissue (biopsy) are taken for laboratory analysis. Sometimes a tissue sample can help in confirming \u00a0a diagnosis.\n\nX-ray:\u00a0A standard X-ray of abdominal area may be done to rule out toxic mega colon or a perforation of the colon, if these conditions are suspected because of severe symptoms.\n\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy:\u00a0In this procedure, doctor uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the last portion of colon (sigmoid colon).\n\nBarium enema:\u00a0This diagnostic test allows to evaluate the entire large intestine with an X-ray. Barium, a contrast solution, is placed into the bowel using an enema. Sometimes, air is added as well. The barium coats the bowel lining, creating a silhouette image of rectum, colon and a portion of the small intestine. This test is rarely and can be dangerous because the pressure required to inflate and coat the colon can lead to rupture of the colon.\u00a0\n\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan:\u00a0A CT scan of the abdomen or pelvis may be performed if physician \u00a0\u00a0suspects a complication from ulcerative colitis or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crohn's disease. A CT scan may also reveal how much of the colon is inflamed.\n\nStool sample:\u00a0The presence of white blood cells in the stool indicates an inflammatory disease, possibly IBD. A stool sample is done to rule out other disorders, such as those caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI):\u00a0An MRI scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. Most MRI machines are large, tube-shaped magnets. During the test, the patient lies on a movable table inside the MRI machine. This test is very helpful in diagnosing and managing Crohn's disease. Its biggest advantage is that there is no radiation exposure. It\u2019s particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic MRI) or the small intestine (MRI enterography).\n\nCapsule endoscopy:\u00a0If there are symptoms that suggest Crohn's disease but other diagnostic tests are negative, the physician \u00a0\u00a0may perform capsule endoscopy. For this test patient needs to swallow a capsule that has a tiny camera in it. The camera takes pictures as it moves through the digestive tract, and the images are transmitted to a computer. The physician \u00a0can see the images, which are then displayed on a monitor and checked for signs of Crohn's disease. Once \u00a0it has made the trip through the digestive system, the camera exits the body painlessly in stool.\n\nDouble-balloon endoscopy:\u00a0For this test, a longer scope is used where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities but the diagnosis is still not clear. It allows for biopsy of the abnormal area.

An intestinal disorder such as celiac disease, which affects the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. If part of the small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect the ability to absorb iron and other nutrients.\n\nPregnancy: Without iron supplementation, iron deficiency anemia occurs in many pregnant women because iron stores need to serve their own increased blood volume as well as be a source of hemoglobin for the developing fetus.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nwww.nhs.uk\n\nwww.cdc.gov", "diagnosis":"To diagnosis Iron deficiency anemia blood test is performed to check the levels of:\n\n\n\t\tHemoglobin (a protein that transports oxygen) will be lower than normal\n\n\t\tFewer red blood cells (cells that contain hemoglobin) than normal\n\n\t\tRed blood cells may be smaller and paler than usual\n\n\t\tTo check the levels of Vitamin B12 or folate as works with vitamin B12 to help your body produce red blood cells.\n\n\n\tTo diagnose the iron deficiency anemia one should consult doctor.\n\nReferences:\u00a0\n\n\nwww.cdc.gov\n\nwww.nhs.uk", "management":"An iron supplement to restore iron deficiency in the body.

There are two kinds of infertility - primary and secondary:\n\n\tPrimary infertility means that the couple has never conceived. Secondary infertility means that the couple has experienced a pregnancy before and failed to conceive later. Globally, most infertile couples suffer from primary infertility.\n\n\tSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the leading preventable cause of infertility by causing 70% of pelvic inflammatory diseases responsible for tubal damage. Low fertility is becoming more common worldwide, particularly in many urban settings where women are planning their first babies at older ages.\n\n\tInfertility affects up to 15% of reproductive-aged couples worldwide. According to World Health Organization estimate the overall prevalence of primary infertility in India is between 3.9 to 16.8%. In Indian states prevalence of infertility varies from state to state such as 3.7 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, to 5 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, and 15 per cent in Kashmir and prevalence varies in same region across tribes and caste.\n\n\tThe inability to have children affects couples and causes emotional and psychological distress in both men and women. Despite the various social, psychological, economic and physical implications, infertility prevention and care often remain neglected public health issues, or at least they rank low on the priority list, especially for low-income countries that are already under population pressure.

Pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID) caused by various infections, endometriosis, pelvic surgery may lead to damage to fallopian tubes. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the common cause of PIDs. \u00a0\n\n(b)Disturb ovarian function/hormonal causes: Synchronized hormonal changes occur during the menstrual cycle leading to the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation) and the thickening of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) in preparation for the fertilized egg (embryo) to implant inside the uterus.

 {"id":152, "name":"Madarosis", "intro":"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy in developing countries, and carries an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. IUGR refers to a condition in which foetus (an unborn baby) is smaller or less developed than normal for the baby's gender and gestational age. Gestational age is the age of a foetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.\n\n\tIn IUGR foetal weight is below the 10th percentile for gestational age as estimated by an ultrasound. At term, the birth weight less than 2,500 g (5lb, or 8oz) is considered as IUGR. Small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction are the other terms used for IUGR. The term intrauterine growth restriction has largely replaced the term intrauterine growth retardation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tIUGR is classified into two types-\n\n\n\t\tSymmetric\u00a0or\u00a0primary\u00a0IUGR: In this condition all internal organs are reduced in size. It is found in 20%-30% of all cases of IUGR.\n\n\t\tAsymmetric\u00a0or\u00a0secondary\u00a0IUGR: In this condition the head and brain are normal in size, but the abdomen is smaller. It is evident mostly in the 3rd\u00a0trimester. It is more common and found in 70% to 80% of total IUGR cases.\n\n\n\tIntrauterine growth restriction is observed in about 24% of newborns. In Asia IUGR accounts for nearly 75% of all affected infants. After prematurity IUGR is the second leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality.\n\n\tGrowth-restricted pregnancies are often complicated by a high rate of antepartum and intrapartum fetal distress and the need for cesarean delivery. These infants have many acute neonatal problems that include perinatal asphyxia, hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and polycythemia (increased red blood cells), jaundice, feeding difficulties, feed intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, and pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\n\tWhen IUGR infants grow up long-term complications include growth retardation, neurodevelopment defects may occur. These infants are more likely to develop adult onset diseases because of fetal epigenetic changes.\n\n\tTimely diagnosis (by assessment of fetal growth at each prenatal visit) and management of IUGR are the major activities in reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nReferences-\n\nmedlineplus.gov/ency/article/002302.htm\n\nemedicine.medscape.com/article/261226-overview\n\nwww.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg_31.pdf\n\nlink.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13669-013-0041-z\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946587/table/t1-cmped-10-2016-067/\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177763/", "symtoms":"The main symptom of IUGR is a small for gestational age baby.

 {"id":154, "name":"Mouth Ulcers", "intro":"Jaundice is a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes. It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues. Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin from the blood to the liver and out of the body\u00a0can cause jaundice.\u00a0Bilirubin\u00a0is a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver.\u00a0There are several ways that a build- up of bilirubin can occur:\n\n\nIf red blood cells broke down too early, the spleen gets overloaded and hence too much bilirubin is produced to be handled by the liver. Unprocessed bilirubin accumulates in the bloodstream and eventually the skin and eyes looks yellow. This condition is called hemolytic anemia. At times this condition is inherited. Hemolytic anemia may also occur as a side-effect of certain drugs.\n\n\t\tSometimes the trouble is in the liver cells. If there is a faulty uptake, processing or excretion of bilirubin it will result in an accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Newborn babies can be temporarily jaundiced because of lack of mature enzymes needed to process bilirubin. In adults,\u00a0alcoholism\u00a0is a common cause of damage to liver cells. Other toxins and certain drugs can also cause acute damage to the liver.\n\n\t\tA blockage in the bile duct can also result in a build-up of fully processed bilirubin. This can spill over into the urine and cause it to become very dark. The blockage is most commonly caused by a gallstone.\n\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.nhs.uk\nwww.cdc.gov\nwww.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.nevdgp.org", "symtoms":"The main symptoms of jaundice are:\n\n\n\t\tYellow discoloration of the eyes and of the skin\n\n\t\tPale coloured stools (faeces)\n\n\t\tDark coloured urine", "causes":"Jaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects.

It is antigenically related to other tick-borne flaviviruses and resembling Russian spring\u2013summer (RSS) complex of viruses.\n\nMode of transmission of KFD virus:\n\n\tThe virus is transmitted to humans by bite of infected unfed nymphs*(immature stage of tick). Human to human transmission is not known.\n\nNatural hosts and reservoirs- Small mammals particularly rats and squirrels are main reservoir of the virus. Monkeys act as amplifying hosts for the virus and disseminate the infection, but most of them die from KFD infection. Cattle maintain tick population by providing them blood meal but play no part in virus maintenance. Man is incidental or dead end host, and plays no role in viral transmission.\n\nVectors- Hard Ticks of genus Haemaphysalis transmit the disease. Spinigera species of Haemaphysalis is the main vector of KFD and is commonly found in Karnataka State, India. Humans become infected through the bite of infected unfed nymphs when they pass through the forests. Adult ticks feed on large animals like cattle. These large animals are good hosts for proliferation of ticks but are not significant for virus dissemination due to insignificant viremia (presence of virus in blood) in them. Ticks also transmit this virus transstadially (from one life stage to next) thus also acts as reservoir for the virus.\n\n\t(*Life cycle of hard ticks- Hard ticks have four developmental forms; egg, larva, nymph and adult (female and male). Adult fed female tick lays eggs on the ground, which hatch to larvae under the vegetations. The larvae further infest and feed on small mammals and monkeys, drop on the ground and change into nymphs. Nymphs feed on small mammals, birds, (as well as accidentally infesting humans), drop on the ground and mature in to adults. Adult ticks usually feed and mate on large animals such as cattle, monkeys. Such type of ticks, feeding on three different hosts is called three-host ticks, one each for the larval, nymphal, and adult life stages).\n\nRisk factors-\n\n\n\t\tPeople with occupational or recreational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks.\n\n\t\tIn Karnataka more cases are reported during the dry season, from November to June.

 {"id":160, "name":"Neonatal Respiratory Disease Syndrome(NRDS)", "intro":"Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, bilateral (but usually asymmetrical) disease of the cornea which results in progressive corneal steepening. It is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Visual loss occurs primarily from myopia and irregular astigmatism and secondarily from corneal scarring.\n\nDuddell in 1729, described a patient with protruding conical corneas and associated poor vision. Keratoconus was initially broadly defined based on the shape and location of the cone. These included round or nipple cones with a central conical protrusion, and oval cones, often with inferior sagging.\n\nMarc Amsler was the first one to describe early corneal topographic changes in keratoconus patients using keratoscope/ placido disc (ophthalmic instrument for detecting abnormal curvature of the cornea). He categorised keratoconus into clinically recognisable stages as:\n\n\nLatent stage: Latent stage was recognisable by placido disc only.\n\nEarly stage: Early stages were subdivided into two categories as:\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconus fruste, which entailed 1- to 4-degree deviation of horizontal axis of the placido disc.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Early or mild keratoconus, which entailed 5- to 8-degree deviation of horizontal axis.\n\n\tThe prevalence of keratoconus in general population appears to be relatively high and is likely to be higher when examined with corneal topography (also called photokeratoscopy or videokeratography). Corneal topography is a computer assisted diagnostic tool that creates a three- dimensional map of the surface of the cornea. Keratoconus occurs in all ethnic groups with no male or female preponderance. It is commonly an isolated ocular condition, but sometimes coexists with other ocular and systemic diseases.\n\n\tCommonly recognised ocular associations include vernal keratoconjunctivitis, retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis; many of the connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes), mitral valve prolapse, atopic dermatitis and Down syndrome.\n\n\tParticular risk factors include atopic history, especially ocular allergies, rigid contact lens wear and vigorous eye rubbing. Most keratoconus cases appear spontaneously, but few may show evidence of genetic transmission.\n\n\tKeratoconus generally manifests at puberty, and is progressive until third to fourth decade of life when it usually arrests. Sometimes, however, it may commence later in life and progress or arrest at any age.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nAgarwal Amar, Agarwal Athiya, Jacob Soosan. Refractive Surgery.

In the past it was believed that more than 90% of cases were sporadic. With the advent of videokeratography to assess family members, however, pedigrees have been analysed. These studies show corneal changes consistent with keratoconus in some family members, which suggest an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\n\n\tKeratoconus may be associated with wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions.\n\nSystemic associations:\n\n\nAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction): One of the most common associations of keratoconus is atopy and is seen in condition like vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Eye rubbing seen in systemic atopy may play a role in the development of keratoconus.\n\nDown syndrome (Trisomy 21): \u00a0In Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), frequency of acute hydrops is higher, perhaps because of eye rubbing and/or these patients are treated infrequently with keratoplasty and their disease is allowed to progress further.\n\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\nMarfan syndrome.\n\nCrouzon syndrome. \n\nApert syndrome.\n\n\nOcular associations: \n\n\nLeber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.\n\nRetinitis pigmentosa.\n\nRetinopathy of prematurity.\n\nFuchs\u2019 corneal endothelial dystrophy.\n\nPosterior polymorphous dystrophy.\n\n\n\tGiven the relatively high prevalence of keratoconus in general population, some of the associations may be coincidental.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nStudies suggest various contributory factors such as:\n\n\nEnzyme abnormalities in corneal epithelium: Enzyme abnormalities such as increased expression of lysosomal enzymes (catalase and cathepsin) and decreased levels of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases), may play a role in corneal stromal degradation.\n\nDifferentially expressed corneal epithelium: Differentially expressed corneal epithelium between keratoconus and myopes (as controls) in both genetic expression and protein expression.\n\nMolecular defect: Molecular defect producing unusual absence of water channel protein aquaporin 5 in keratoconus as compared to normal corneal epithelium.\n\nGelatinolytic activity: Gelatinolytic activity in stroma has been described, which may be due to decreased function of enzyme inhibitors.\n\nAbnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking: Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking may be the cause of keratoconus.\n\nEye rubbing: Cytokine has been suggested as a mediator of eye rubbing and stromal degradation. Keratoconus in patients with atopic dermatitis, Down syndrome, and Leber congenital amaurosis, a congenital photoreceptor degeneration, could be related to forceful eye rubbing or the oculodigital reflex. The latter is a behavioural pattern seen in visually and mentally handicapped children who repeatedly strike their eyes with hands.\n\nHard contact lens wear.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPathophysiology:\n\n\tAll layers of the cornea are believed to be affected by keratoconus, although the most notable features are the thinning of the corneal stroma, the fragmentation of the Bowman layer and the deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells, forming the Fleischer ring. Folds and breaks in the Descemet\u2019s membrane result in acute hydrops and striae, which produces variable amount of diffuse scarring.", "diagnosis":"Refraction, keratometry, corneal topography and slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination helps in reaching to the diagnosis of keratoconus.\n\nRefraction: Patients with keratoconus often report blurring/impairment of vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. There may be multiple unsatisfactory attempts in obtaining optimum correction with glasses. Spectacles and soft contact lenses may initially give satisfactory vision, but vision tends to decline over time and requires rigid gas-permeable contact lenses for correction.\n\nKeratometry: Images of keratometry mires commonly will be steep, highly astigmatic, irregular, and often appear egg-shaped rather than circular or oval in keratoconus. A value of 47.2 Diopters (D) or greater is suggestive of keratoconus. These signs may be absent in some patients of keratoconus.\n\nCorneal topography/Computerised videokeratography: is helpful in reaching a diagnosis, especially when the typical bio-microscopy signs of Vogt striae and Fleischer ring are absent. Several quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconus.\n\nUltrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry may be useful to confirm corneal thinning in patients with suspected keratoconus on slit- lamp examination or videokeratography. Orbscan corneal topography system and Oculus Pentacam which provides both topography and pachymetry maps are particularly useful in making a diagnosis.\n\n\tKeratoconus is differentiated according to severity of disease as well as shape of cornea.\n\nShape- based differentiation:\n\n\tConical shapes of cornea are differentiated as:\n\n\nNipple cones: Nipple cones have a diameter of 5mm or less and are located in the center or slightly below the center of the cornea.\n\nOval cones: Oval cones are larger in diameter and are inferonasally or inferotemporally to the center of the cornea.\n\nGlobus cones: Globus cones are large and involve about 75% of the surface of cornea and are least common.\n\n\nSeverity- based differentiation:\n\nI. Mild keratoconus:\n\n\tExternal and corneal signs are often absent or are minimal.\n\n\nSpectacle correction: A history of multiple inadequate spectacle corrections of one or both eyes and it may show oblique astigmatism as well as moderate-to-high myopia on refraction.\n\nKeratometry values: Irregularly astigmatic keratometry values, not necessarily on the steep side of normal (approximately 45 Diopters), are consistent with diagnosis.\n\nComputer-assisted videokeratography: Computer-assisted videokeratography may reveal,\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inferior corneal steepening (approximately 80% of keratoconus patients),\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Central corneal astigmatic steepening (approximately 15% of keratoconus patients),\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even bilateral temporal steepening (extremely rare).\n\n\nOptical coherence tomography pachymetry (OCT pachymetry): Optical coherence tomography pachymetry shows paraxial corneal thinning.\n\nDiagnostic rigid contact lens: On application of diagnostic rigid contact lens with its base curve equal to the flat keratometry reading after instilling fluorescein sodium dye, a typical nipple pattern is seen in the underlying tear film.\n\nCorneal sensitivity: Corneal sensitivity is reduced.\n\nTear secretions: Tear secretions are decreased.\n\n\nII. Moderate keratoconus:\n\n\nRetinoscopy: On retinoscopy, there may be distortion of reflex which shows \u2018scissoring reflex\u2019.\n\nCharleaux\u2019s sign: Charleaux oil droplet reflex is a bright reflex from the conical apex surrounded by a dark circular shadow produced by corneal ectasia.\u00a0 Charleaux\u2019s sign or oil drop sign is visualised on observation of the cornea with the pupil dilated using a direct ophthalmoscope set on plano.\n\nMunson sign: Munson sign is the \u2018V\u2019 shape protrusion produced in the lower lid by cornea on down gaze.\n\nRizutti\u2019s sign: Rizutti\u2019s sign is an arrowhead pattern at the nasal limbus being produced by focusing of a light beam shown from temporally across the cornea.\n\nProminent corneal nerves: There may be enhanced appearance of corneal nerves.\n\nVogt striae (fine stress lines): Patients may show Vogt striae (fine stress lines) in the deep stroma. These deep stromal stress lines clear when pressure is applied to the globe.\n\nFleischer ring: Deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells in a ring shape (often partial) at the base of the conical protrusion, called the Fleischer ring.\n\nCorneal scarring: Corneal scarring may be present at various levels.\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superficial corneal scarring, which may be fibular, nebular or nodular.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deep stromal scarring perhaps represents resolved mini-hydrops.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Some patients show scarring at the level of the Descemet membrane, consistent in appearance with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. This may be a variant of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.\n\n\nKeratometry values: Keratometry values are 45- 52 Diopters. There may be pulsation of the reflected images on standard keratometry because thinned cornea readily transmits the ocular pulse.\n\n\n\tSimilar pulsations of the mires on applanation tonometry may be noted.\n\n\nOptical coherence tomography pachymetry: Optical coherence tomography pachymetry shows paraxial (usually inferior to the pupil) stromal thinning.\n\n\nIII. Advanced keratoconus:\n\n\nEnhancement of all corneal sign, symptoms, and visual loss/ distortion, including Vogt striae, Fleischer ring, and/or scarring, is present.\n\nAcute corneal hydrops: Acute corneal hydrops results in acute overhydration of the cornea and accumulation of fluid within the corneal stroma due to acute rupture of Descemet\u2019s membrane. The overlying corneal epithelium may become oedematous, and fluid may leak through the corneal epithelium. The ruptured Descemet\u2019s membrane curls in on itself, and over time endothelial cells spread over the posterior stromal defect.\n\nKeratometry: Keratometry values are greater than 52 Diopters.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGrading keratoconus:\n\n\tSeveral quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconic corneal shape factors. The two most commonly known indices are those of Rabinowitz and Maeda and Klyce.\n\nI. Rabinowitz index: Rabinowitz created KISA% index, which provides an algorithm to quantify results from computerised videokeratoscopy. The KISA% index uses:\n\n\n\t\tThe corneal central keratometry (K value) value, which indicates central corneal steepening.\n\n\t\tThe inferior- superior dioptric asymmetry (I- S) value\n\n\t\tThe keratometric astigmatism (AST) index, which quantifies the degree of regular corneal astigmatism based on (SimK1- SimK2). Simulated keratometry (SimK) index provides information on the diopteric power of the flattest and most curved meridians. Numerically, it is expressed as K1 and K2, and the difference (SimK1- SimK2) between the two values provides a quantitative value of corneal astigmatism.\n\n\t\tThe skewed radial axis (SRAX) value: Skew of steepest radial axis measures the angle between the more curved superior semi- meridian and the more curved inferior semi- meridian.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tRabinowitz diagnostic criteria consist of three corneal topography derived indices, which, when abnormal in value, should alert the clinician to consider a diagnosis of keratoconus. These indices are:\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nK value (Central keratometry) quantifies the central steepening of the cornea that occurs in keratoconus. A value of 47.20 D or greater is suggestive of keratoconus.\n\nI-S value (inferior- superior value) quantifies the inferior versus superior corneal diopteric asymmetry that occurs in keratoconus. A positive value indicates higher inferior curvature while a negative value indicates higher superior curvature. I-S values between 1.4D and 1.8D are defined as cut- off points for suspected keratoconus. I-S values higher than 1.8D are defined as cut- off points for clinical keratoconus.\n\nKISA% incorporates the K, I-S values, SRAX and AST with a measure quantifying regular and irregular astigmatism into one index. This index is highly sensitive and specific in separating normal from keratoconic corneas. A value of greater than 100% is highly suggestive of keratoconus, and the range from 60 to 100% represents suspected keratoconus.\n\n\nII. Maeda and Klyce computer expert program: Maeda and Klyce designed a computer expert program, based on linear discriminant analysis of 8 indices drawn from the corneal map and a binary decision tree. The program assigns the topographical map a quantitative percentage score of the severity of keratoconus called the keratoconus index% (KCI%). A value of greater than zero is believed to be suggestive of keratoconus.\n\nIII. McMahon and colleague keratoconus severity score (KSS): McMahon and colleagues and the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) study, have proposed a method called the keratoconus severity score (KSS) for grading the severity of keratoconus. The KSS score utilises:\n\n\n\t\tClinical signs (Vogt\u2019s striae, Fleischer ring, corneal scarring).\n\n\t\tTwo corneal topography indices (average corneal power and the root mean square (RMS) error for higher- order aberrations).\n\n\t\tManual interpretation of the topography map to form a 1-to-5 grading system.\n\n\nAdvantages of KSS score:\n\n\n\t\tKSS system provides good reproducibility.\n\n\t\tIt is not limited to the use of one topographer.\n\n\t\tUnlike KISA% index, it grades the severity of keratoconus rather than just identifying presence or absence of the condition.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology:\n\n\tAll layers of the cornea are affected by keratoconus. Keratoconus shows irregular epithelium, breaks in Bowman\u2019s layer, and fibrosis filling in the breaks that extend beneath the epithelium. Iron deposition in the basal corneal epithelial cells forms the characteristic Fleischer ring. With hydrops, breaks at the layer of Descemet\u2019s membrane are seen, with inward curling of Descemet\u2019s membrane, which is otherwise normal. Some studies have reported endothelial cell loss in association with the rupture of the Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nElectron microscopy shows decreased thickness of the cornea with fewer lamellae. The collagen fibrils in the lamellae are thickened mildly and the space between fibrils is increased.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\tKeratoconus should be distinguished from other ectatic and thinning disorders such as:\n\n\n\t\tPellucid marginal degeneration.\n\n\t\tTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration.\n\n\t\tKeratoglobus.\n\n\t\tPost-traumatic corneal ectasia.\n\n\t\tProtrusion of cornea subsequent to corneal thinning from ulceration.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tThe distinction can usually be made by slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination and corneal topography.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nSpectacle correction: Initially, attempt should be made to correct myopic astigmatism by prescribing spectacle correction. Early keratoconus patients may get satisfactory vision with spectacles. Development of irregular astigmatism often limits the use of spectacle correction, and patients may require contact lenses.\n\nRigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses are often the first lenses of choice and may be prescribed once spectacle-corrected acuity becomes inadequate. Other lenses used are piggyback lenses, pure hydro gel lenses, multi curve or aspheric contact lenses. Contact lens wear often is complicated by episodes of intolerance, allergic reactions (e.g. giant papillary conjunctivitis), corneal abrasions, neovascularisation, sometimes leading to total intolerance. Though contact lenses are extremely useful, it may increase the risk of corneal scarring.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy: \n\n\tSurgical therapy may be resorted to when patient does not improve with the use of contact lenses.\n\n\tContact lenses may fail due to:\n\n\n\t\tInadequate acuity.\n\n\t\tInadequate lens tolerance.\n\n\t\tFrequent lens displacements.\n\n\t\tPeripheral thinning.\n\n\nSurgical procedures:\n\n\nKeratoplasty: Standard surgical treatment consists of keratoplasty. Recurrence of keratoconus after keratoplasty is rare. Recurrence may be due to:\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Incomplete excision of the cone at the time of surgery.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unrecognised keratoconus in the corneal donor.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Host cellular activity that causes changes in the donor corneal material.\n\nLamellar keratoplasty: Lamellar keratoplasty is effective, but this is not preferred because of the technical difficulties in the procedure and slightly reduced visual outcome.\n\nEpikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty has been successful as well, but it has been abandoned due to suboptimal visual outcome.\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty: By far the most frequent procedure is penetrating keratoplasty. At the time of keratoplasty, decreasing the donor/ recipient size disparity reduces post-keratoplasty myopia. Complications of penetrating keratoplasty include corneal graft rejection, glaucoma, cataract formation, anisometropia, astigmatism and infection.\n\nDeep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has been proposed as an alternative to penetrating keratoplasty. Recent advances in surgical technique have generated interest in DALK. Primary advantages are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increased structural integrity.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reduced risk of graft rejection.\n\n\tWhile challenging to perform, innovative techniques such as the big-bubble technique have reduced surgical operating time, improved the safety of the procedure, and gives visual outcome similar to penetrating keratoplasty. Complications of DALK include graft- host interface haze, Descemet\u2019s membrane perforation and stromal rejection.\n\n\nIntra-corneal ring segments: Intra-corneal ring segments have achieved some success in patients without corneal scarring in reducing the myopia and astigmatism and improving spectacle- corrected visual acuity. INTACS (Addition Technology, Fermont, CA) are intrastromal corneal ring segments, placed in the peripheral cornea, either mechanically or with the femtosecond laser.\n\nCombined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking: Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking consists of photo-polymerisation of corneal stroma by combining vitamin B2 (photosensitising substance) with UVA. This process increases rigidity of corneal collagen and thus reduces the likelihood of further ectasia.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tKeratoconus, though progressive initially, stabilises after some time in most of the patient. Most patients with keratoconus do well with rigid contact lenses.\n\n\tKeratoplasty may be required when patients do not improve with contact lenses.\n\n\tFortunately, patients with keratoconus never become totally blind.", "complications":"Complications of keratoconus may be:\n\n\nAcute corneal hydrops: Advanced keratoconus rarely may progress to acute corneal hydrops due to breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane, leading to corneal oedema.\n\nSecondary corneal scarring.", "Prevention":"Prevention of KFD includes vaccination, personal protection and control of ticks in KFD endemic areas.\n\n\n\t\tA killed vaccine exists for KFD and is used in endemic areas (disease occurs regularly in a particular\u00a0area) in India.\n\n\n\n\t\tAdditional preventive measures include insect repellents and wearing protective clothing (wear light coloured clothing with a long-sleeved shirt tucked into pants and long-legged pants tucked into socks and gum boots) while going in KFD endemic forest areas.

 {"id":161, "name":"Neuralgia", "intro":"Keratoglobus is a rare non-inflammatory corneal thinning disorder characterised by generalised thinning and globular ectasis (protrusion) of the cornea. The non-inflammatory corneal ectasias are a group of disorders characterised by corneal thinning, protrusion, and scarring. Keratoglobus forms a rarer subset of this group. \u00a0\n\n\tKeratoglobus was first described as a separate clinical entity by Verrey in 1947, through detailed descriptions of his patients. In the past, it was considered synonymous with megalocornea and congenital glaucoma.\n\n\tThe exact genetics and pathogenesis of this disorder is still not clear. There are similarities with other non-inflammatory thinning disorder like keratoconus, which gave rise to hypothesis about the aetiopathogenesis.\n\n\tKeratoglobus and keratoconus are both non-inflammatory ectatic disorders of the cornea. Cavara in 1950 made distinction between keratoglobus and keratoconus. The cornea in keratoglobus is diffusely thinned, often more markedly in the peripheral cornea, whereas in keratoconus the thinning is most prominent in the central cornea. The histopathological changes seen in keratoglobus, including disruption of Bowman's layer and Descemet's membrane breaks, are very similar to those seen in advanced keratoconus. These similarities have brought about confusion as to whether the disorders comprising this group are separate clinical disorders, or rather a spectrum of the same disease process. \u00a0In fact, the histological similarities have led to the speculation that keratoglobus may be an end-stage manifestation of advanced keratoconus.\n\n\tClinical presentation is characterised by progressive diminution of vision resulting from irregular corneal topography with increased corneal fragility due to extreme thinning. Conservative and surgical management for visual rehabilitation and improved tectonic (structural) stability have been described, but are challenging. In the absence of a definitive standard procedure for management of this disorder, various surgical procedures have been attempted in order to overcome the difficulties.\n\n\tBoth congenital and acquired forms have been shown to occur, and may be associated with various other ocular and systemic syndromes including the connective tissue disorders.\n\nCongenital form is present at birth and is associated with:\n\n\n\t\tEhlers- Danlos syndrome type VI.\n\n\t\tBlue sclera syndrome.\n\n\t\tLeber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.\n\n\nAcquired form presents in adulthood and may evolve from pre-existing cases of keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration. It is associated with:\n\n\n\t\tChronic marginal blepharitis.\n\n\t\tDysthyroid ophthalmopathy.\n\n\t\tVernal keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v27/n9/full/eye2013130a.html\n\nhttp://eyewiki.aao.org/Keratoglobus\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821018\n\nBasak Samar K.

The congenital form of the disorder is always bilateral. The exact genetics of the disorder have not been studied in detail and no definite inheritance pattern has been described. It is assumed to be autosomal recessive.\n\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It has also been associated with:\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t- Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type VI: Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type VI is distinct for its ocular manifestations. These include corneal abnormalities of cornea plana, keratoconus and keratoglobus, blue sclera, and ocular fragility. Other systemic features in this type are the presence of hypermobile joints, skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis, pectus excavatum, a marfanoid habitus, and hearing loss. Skin laxity and fragility is not a characteristic finding, unlike in other types of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes, and lysyl hydroxylase activity may be normal.\n\n\t- Marfan syndrome.\n\n\t- Rubinstein\u2013Taybi syndrome.\n\n\t- Blue sclera syndromes: Blue sclera syndromes may be the manifestation of syndromes like Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type VI or osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n\t- Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nAcquired: In recent years, there have been reports of acquired forms of keratoglobus. It has been associated with disorders such as:\n\n\n\t- Vernal keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t- Chronic marginal blepharitis.\n\n\t- Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy.\n\n\t- Idiopathic orbital inflammation.\n\n\tCase reports of keratoglobus being associated with syphilis, trauma and posterior polymorphous dystrophy have also been reported in the literature.\n\n\tThere are reports of keratoconus and keratoglobus, as well as pellucid marginal corneal degeneration and keratoglobus being clinically documented in the same patient over time. Overlaps in aetiological factors between keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, and keratoglobus, such as their manifestations in connective tissue disorders and various acquired forms leads to speculation about their being different spectrums of the same disease. However, a constant association and progression between these ectatic disorders has not been described to validate the hypothesis.", "diagnosis":"The diagnosis of keratoglobus is essentially clinical, owing to the characteristic clinical findings. In less severe cases, there may be difficulty in differentiating the condition from other ectatic conditions.\n\n\tKeratoglobus, a bilateral ectatic disorder of the cornea, is characterised by a globular protrusion of the cornea associated with diffuse thinning from limbus to limbus. The age of onset is at birth.\n\n\tPatients usually present with stable or worsening bilateral visual impairment which may not be corrected with spectacles or contact lenses. Rarely, patient may present with acute pain in eyes due to acute hydrops.\n\n\tClinical diagnosis is made by slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy) of the eye.\n\nClinical features:\n\n\n\t\tIrregular retinoscopic reflex.\n\n\t\tMyopia or high myopia.\n\n\t\tIrregular astigmatism.\n\n\t\tGlobular protrusion of cornea.\n\n\t\tDiffuse corneal thinning, most severe in peripheral part and may be up to one- fifth of the normal corneal thickness.\n\n\t\tFolds, breaks, or thickening of Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\n\t\tSpontaneous rupture or tear of Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\n\t\tClear cornea unless there are episodes of acute hydrops and scarring.\n\n\t\tNormal corneal diameter, which distinguishes it from buphthalmos.\n\n\t\tVogt striae and Fleischer\u2019s rings are not associated, unlike keratoconus.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nInvestigational procedures:\n\n\nCorneal topography or videokeratography: Corneal topography or videokeratography show diffuse thinning.\n\nUltrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry shows reduced corneal thickness.\n\nAnterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS- OCT).\n\nScheimpflug analysis: A Scheimpflug system images the anterior segment by creating an optical section of the cornea. Topography and pachymetry of the cornea is calculated and displayed which shows generalised thinning.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSystemic examination may show features of blue sclera, skeletal abnormalities, hyper-mobility of joints, hearing loss, abnormal dentition or high-arched palate. There may be features specific to each syndrome. It has been seen in few cases that keratoglobus in association with blue sclera syndromes is more probable to undergo spontaneous perforation or after minimal trauma, and hence the name \u2018brittle cornea\u2019 is used.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology:\n\n\tThere are frequent disruptions or complete absence of Bowman\u2019s layer, stromal thinning and disorganisation, and breaks or thickening of Descemet\u2019s membrane. Acquired type of keratoglobus is characterised by an essentially normal Bowman\u2019s layer that undergoes focal breaks with superficial stromal ectasia secondary to other corneal pathology.\n\nImmunohistochemical studies: There are limited immunohistochemical studies in cases of keratoglobus. Meghpara et al. (2009) found decreased expression of proteinase inhibitor alpha-1-PI, and increased expression of the transcription factor Sp1 in the corneal epithelial cells. They found increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 2, and 3 within the epithelial cells. The MMPs are responsible for degradation of some component of the extracellular matrix. Increased Sp1 and MMP 1, 2, and 3 was found diffusely throughout the cornea, but maximally at the mid-periphery and corresponded to areas of underlying Bowman\u2019s layer disruptions. The increased expression of pro-degradation products and decreased expression of inhibitory substances is most probably a key pathogenic factor in causing ectasia.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\nKeratoconus: Keratoconus develops around puberty and may progress until 40\u201350 years of age, whereas keratoglobus presents at birth. Keratoglobus is considered a non-progressive or minimally progressive disorder. The corneal thinning in keratoconus is most commonly seen in the inferior paracentral aspect of the cornea. The protrusion is commonly described as conical in shape, with maximal thinning at the apex. Keratoglobus presents with diffuse thinning and a globular protrusion. Keratoconus shows scarring, Vogt\u2019s striae and Fleischer\u2019s ring.\n\nPellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration presents around 20\u201340 years of age. Thinning involves the inferior aspect of cornea, as a band of 1\u20132\u2009mm width and extending from 4 to 8 o\u2019clock position. Protrusion occur superior to this area of thinning, leading to characteristic topographical patterns. Scarring and hydrops may also occur as well.\n\nCongenital glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma may show moderate protrusion of the cornea, hydrops, and mild astigmatism with myopia. Hallmark of Congenital glaucoma is raised intraocular pressure and possible glaucomatous optic nerve changes that would be absent in the case of keratoglobus. There is no corneal thinning and corneal diameters may be increased. In congenital glaucoma, the myopia would result primarily from the increased anterior and posterior axial length, whereas in keratoglobus it would be mainly because of the increased corneal curvature.\n\nMegalocornea: In megalocornea, the main differentiating feature is the increased corneal diameter (usually over 12.5\u2009mm) with absence of any corneal thinning. This is in contrast to keratoglobus where corneal diameters are normal and there is profound, diffuse thinning. There is therefore an absence of any corneal protrusion, astigmatism, hydrops, or scarring in cases of megalocornea.\n\nCorneal ectasia following refractive surgery.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nConservative therapy:\n\n\nProtective eye wear: Patients should use protective eye wear and avoid contact sports owing to the high risk of perforation. Enforcement of use of protective glasses is difficult in children, making them susceptible to injury.\n\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nSpectacle correction: High myopia may be corrected with spectacles, but is limited by high irregular astigmatism.\n\nContact lenses: Use of contact lenses is still a matter of debate because of the theoretical risk of perforation on contact lens insertion and removal over corneas that are known to perforate on even trivial trauma. The extreme protrusion and irregularity makes fitting complicated, with a need for balance between optical improvement and lens stability. Customised fitting of scleral lenses, small diameter rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, reverse geometry hydrogel lenses, as well as large diameter inverse geometry RGP lenses have been described for corneal ectasias.\n\n\n\tConventional treatment of acute hydrops is nonspecific, and involves the use of patching, bandage contact lens, topical hypertonic saline, and cycloplegics to reduce the oedema. In recent years intra-cameral (in anterior chamber of eye) gas has been tried for acute hydrops.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tSurgically, there is no known standard procedure for management of the condition owing to its rarity. Individual procedures have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\n\nRepair of perforations: Repair of perforations commonly resulted in poor outcomes because of the nature of the perforations that are usually large, and owing to the fragility of the thinned cornea that prevented stable placement of sutures that would cut through or \u2018cheese-wire\u2019.\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty in keratoglobus is also not possible because of the thinned cornea and peripheral graft\u2013host thickness disparity that prevents adequate wound closure. Patients also are left with extreme irregular astigmatism and ultimately poor visual outcome. Large limbus to limbus donor corneal grafts have been tried to avoid placement of the graft\u2013host junction at the thinned mid-periphery, thereby creating better stability.\n\nPentacam- based deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue. Use of pentacam provides a three-dimensional image or thickness profile of the entire cornea preoperatively.\n\nCorneoscleroplasty: \u00a0Corneoscleroplasty involves a central full thickness penetrating keratoplasty with a lamellar peripheral corneoscleral dissection from the edge of the full thickness keratoplasty.\n\nEpikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction.\n\n\u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty: \u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.\n\nCorneoscleral rim: Corneoscleral rim is a temporary measure to provide tectonic stability over thinned corneal periphery. It slows progression of mid- peripheral thinning and delays further surgical intervention.\n\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tThe prognosis for keratoglobus is poor. Spectacle correction often results in sub-optimal \u2018best corrected visual acuity\u2019 (BCVA).\n\n\tSurgical correction may be associated with complications.", "complications":"Complications of keratoglobus may be:\n\n\nAcute corneal hydrops: Advanced keratoglobus rarely may progress to acute corneal hydrops due to breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane, leading to corneal oedema.\n\nCorneal perforation: Corneal perforation may occur either spontaneously or following minor trauma.", "Prevention":"To prevent keratoconus, patients should avoid rubbing of eyes.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

 {"id":168, "name":"Osteoporosis", "intro":"Ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare, potentially sight and even life-threatening (e.g. by airway obstruction) disorder characterised by recurrent, often bilateral fibrin-rich pseudo-membranous lesions of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva. It is the main clinical manifestation of systemic plasminogen deficiency and typically presents in childhood. There appears to be a higher incidence in females as compared to males. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as conjunctiva. \u00a0Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators in the blood. Plasmin is a serine protease and is the predominant fibrinolytic enzyme in the human circulation, and is also found in the extracellular matrix. Plasmin plays an important role in haemostasis, as well as, is an integral component of wound healing (acts by degrading fibrin). Due to plasminogen deficiency, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, which on desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Episodes may be triggered by relatively minor trauma, surgery (done particularly for pterygium or pinguecula) or by systemic events such as fever and anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Similar mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.\n\nBouisson in 1847 first described a man with bilateral pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis (Bouisson M. Ophthalmic sur-aigue avec formation de pseudo-membranes a la surface de la conjonctive. Ann Ocul, 1847; 17: 100-4). In 1933, the term \u2018ligneous\u2019, meaning \u2018woody\u2019 was introduced by Borel \u00a0to describe the characteristic wood-like consistency of the pseudo-membranes (Borel MG. Un nouveau syndrome palpebral. Bull Soc Fr Ophthalmol 1933; 46: 168-80). However, the link between LC and plasminogen deficiency was established in 1997 by Mingers et al (Mingers AM, Heimburger N, Zeitler P, et al. Homozygous type I plasminogen deficiency. Semin Thromb Hemost 1997; 23:259-69). As many patients develop similar pseudo-membranes in other mucous membranes of the body, Mingers et al. suggested the term \u2018pseudo-membranous disease\u2019 to describe the systemic nature of this disease. Although the lesions have been referred to as pseudo-membranous (a pseudo-membrane consists of a loose fibrin-cellular debris exudates not adherent to the underlying epithelium, from which it can be easily stripped, usually without bleeding) in the literature, the lesions are actually true membranes (a true membrane consists of an exudate of fibrin-cellular debris firmly attached to the underlying epithelium by fibrin. On attempted removal, the epithelium is stripped off and leaves a raw bleeding surface).\n\n\tLC is rare, and the prevalence of this disorder has not been firmly established. LC can occur in older individuals, despite it being classically associated with infants and children.\n\nLess frequently, LC may lead to similar membrane formation in mucous membranes of other organs, such as:\n\n\n\t\tOral cavity (ligneous gingivitis).\n\n\t\tGastrointestinal tracts.\n\n\t\tUpper and lower respiratory tracts (sinus, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs).\n\n\t\tEars.\n\n\t\tFemale genital tracts.\n\n\t\tRenal collecting system.\n\n\nRarely, it may also cause:\n\n\n\t\tJuvenile colloid milium of the skin.\n\n\t\tOcclusive hydrocephalus.\n\n\n\tSeveral studies have shown extra-ocular manifestations of severe plasminogen deficiency even without ocular involvement.\n\n\tHistopathological findings indicate that impaired wound healing, mainly of injured mucosal tissue, is due to markedly decreased, plasmin-mediated extracellular fibrinolysis.\n\n\tLC is characterised by multiple recurrences after local excision, and management involves the adjunctive use of topical and systemic replacement of plasminogen.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.ijo.in/article.asp?issn=0301-4738;year=2012;volume=60;issue=6;spage=563;epage=566;aulast=Tok\n\nhttps://www.hemophilia.org/sites/default/files/document/files/PlasminogenDeficiency.pdf\n\nHollandEdward J, Mannis Mark J, Lee W Barry.

The impaired wound healing capacity causes an arrest of granulation tissue formation and excessive fibrin deposition. Thus, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, stimulating inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, while desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Similar patho-physiologic mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.\n\n\tWhile in extra-vascular spaces, fibrinolysis, with low to non-existent levels of plasminogen activity, is impaired. However, in vessels this is not the case, as can be inferred from the fact that thrombotic phenomena is absent in patients with LC and plasminogen deficiency. It has been suggested that non-plasmin induced fibrinolysis is intensified in patients with plasminogen deficiency and ligneous conjunctivitis.\n\n\t\u00a0Genetics of disease:\n\n\tGenetics of the disease allows for prenatal diagnosis in known carrier families, which may be crucial in cases of obstructive congenital hydrocephalous.\n\n\tDevelopment of ligneous lesions is caused by:\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\t\tSporadic mutations in plasminogen gene. This is the most common cause. The gene for plasminogen is located on chromosome 6, and is produced predominantly by the liver.\n\n\t\tCompound-heterozygous mutations.\n\n\t\tHomozygous mutations.\n\t\t\nTissue injury:\n\n\t\t\tDue to the appearance, histopathology, clinical course, and response to treatment, it is also believed that LC results from an exaggerated inflammatory response to tissue injury. This injury may arise from infection or physical trauma, including surgery. These factors may incite a genetic predisposition, such as plasminogen deficiency, to develop this response. Schuster and Seregard also postulated that conjunctivitis is the most common manifestation of plasminogen deficiency, due to frequent exposure to ocular irritants (Schuster V, Seregard S. Ligneous Conjunctivitis. Surv Ophthalmol 2003; 48: 369-88). These irritants may start or perpetuate local inflammation and create ligneous membranes.\n\n\t\t\tMany cases of antecedent viral or bacterial infections have been described, including staphylococcal, streptococcal, and haemophilus conjunctivitis. In these cases, it appears that LC, in genetically susceptible individuals, develops as an abnormal response to the conjunctival trauma elicited by the infecting organisms.\n\nTrauma, especially from surgery, is also thought to be a cause of LC. LC appears to develop as an abnormal response of the immune system to the conjunctival trauma.", "diagnosis":"The diagnosis of LC is based on the clinical picture (ocular and/or extra-ocular membranous lesions), the typical histological findings, and a possible positive family history. In most patients with LC, hypo-plasminogenaemia may be found.\n\n\tIf the responsible mutation has been identified in an affected family, then prenatal diagnosis of children at risk is possible.\n\nOcular Features:\n\n\tExamination of eyes should be carried out under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.\n\n\tPatients typically present with chronic conjunctivitis. Discharge or membranes are not seen in the early stages.\n\nConjunctival ligneous lesions: The earliest true ligneous lesion appears as a highly vascularised, raised, friable lesion. It may be covered by a thick yellow-white mucoid discharge. This lesion can be removed easily with forceps, although it tends to bleed on removal. With continued inflammation, a white, thickened, avascular mass appears above the neo-vascular membrane. Attempts at removal of this lesion often results in recurrence of the lesion to its original size within days. These lesions are most often seen on the palpebral conjunctiva of the upper and lower eyelids but may also be found on the bulbar conjunctiva, including the limbus. Bulbar conjunctival involvement may occur either de novo or from extension of a palpebral lesion. Despite appropriate therapy, inflammation may continue, and the chronic lesions become thickened, vascularised, and firm, giving rise to the name \u2018ligneous\u2019 meaning woody.\n\nCorneal lesions: Limbal lesions may extend over the surface of the cornea and may lead to corneal:\n\n\n\t\tNeovascularisation.\n\n\t\tScarring.\n\n\t\tInfection.\n\n\t\tMelting.\n\n\n\t\u00a0Systemic Features:\n\nFever or infections of the upper respiratory tract, urinary tract, or female genital tract, may either precede or concomitantly occur with LC, or might even act as a trigger for the development of membranes.\n\nOro-pharynx:\n\n\tMembranous lesions may cause:\n\n\n\t\tLoss of dental integrity.\n\n\t\tPainless nodular ulcers.\n\n\t\tGingival hyperplasia.\n\n\nEars:\n\n\tMembranous lesions may occur on:\n\n\n\t\tTympanic membrane.\n\n\t\tMiddle ear causing otitis media.\n\n\nRespiratory Tract:\n\n\tLigneous lesions may involve:\n\n\n\t\tLarynx.\n\n\t\tVocal cords.\n\n\t\tTrachea.\n\n\t\tBronchial tree.\n\n\nGenitourinary Tract:\n\n\tLigneous lesions in female genital tract may involve:\n\n\n\t\tCervix causing ligneous cervicitis.\n\n\t\tVagina.\n\n\t\tFallopian tubes.\n\n\t\tOvary.\n\n\t\tEndometrium.\n\n\nJuvenile Colloid Milium:\n\n\tThis is a rare skin condition characterised by the development of small, yellow-brown, translucent papules, typically in sun-exposed areas of the skin. It tends to occur prior to puberty.\n\nCongenital Occlusive Hydrocephalus:\n\n\tLC patients are also reported to suffer from congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis:\n\n\nAbnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen: Laboratory analysis confirms disorder with an abnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen. Since ligneous lesions are most commonly seen in type I plasminogen deficiency, the antigen test alone is insufficient to rule out this disease.\n\nPrenatal testing: Prenatal testing to identify genetic mutations may be conducted to identify this disease.\n\n\nHistopathological/ Immuno-histochemical evaluation:\n\n\tHistological examination of ligneous membranes shows superficial or sub-epithelial deposits of eosinophilic amorphous hyaline, amyloid-like material with a variable proportion of granulation tissue with accompanying inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and granulocytes). This amorphous hyaline material contains mainly fibrin and other plasma proteins, such as albumin and immune-globulins (mainly IgG). Ligneous lesions may also contain variable amounts of muco-polysaccharides in adjacent granulation tissue. Abnormal vascular permeability has also been suggested as the source of various components of the ligneous lesions. Melikian postulated that a sero-fibrinous transudate from the conjunctival neovascularisation undergoes subsequent coagulation, with the resulting formation of granulation tissue and accumulation of the hyaline material, which becomes hardened and form ligneous membranes. (Melikian H E. Treatment of ligneous conjunctivitis. Ann Ophthalmol 1985; 17: 763-65)\n\n\tImmuno-histochemical evaluation of LC lesions showed a cellular infiltrate that was composed mainly of T lymphocytes. Immuno-fluorescent techniques demonstrated that the major components of the hyaline material in the substantia propria were immune-globulins (mainly IgG).\n\n\tTopical cyclosporine A has been reported to be more effective than other topical agents (short of plasminogen preparations) in the treatment of this disorder. Cyclosporine A prevents the activation and recruitment of the T-cell response. Finally, a decrease in the number of B lymphocytes and plasma cells occur. These results indicate the local effect of cyclosporine A on the immune-response. The clinical response and histopathological confirmation of the effect of Cyclosporine A further support the inflammatory nature of this disease.\n\nLigneous conjunctivitis should be differentiated from:\n\n\tAny inflammatory or infectious disease which can cause a chronic pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis, such as:\n\n\nViral conjunctivitis:\n\n\n\n\t\tHerpes simplex infection.\n\n\t\tEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t\tMolluscum contagiosum.\n\n\n\nBacterial conjunctivitis:\n\n\n\n\t\tStaphylococcus aureus.\n\n\t\tStreptococcus haemolyticus.\n\n\t\tNeisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\n\t\tChlamydia trachomatis.\n\n\t\tCorynebacterium diphtheriae.\n\n\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis:\n\n\n\n\t\tVernal keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\n\nToxic conjunctivitis:\n\nChemical conjunctivitis:\n\n\n\n\t\tAcid.\n\n\t\tAlkali.\n\n\n\nStevens-Johnson syndrome.\n\nAmyloidosis.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tManagement of LC tends to be unsatisfactory and spontaneous resolution is rare.\n\n\tIt is important to discontinue any anti-fibrinolytic therapy.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nPlasminogen substitution: Systemic and topical plasminogen substitution or Fresh Frogen Plasma (FFP) is presently being investigated as the primary treatment for ligneous conjunctivitis. Mingers et al. first proposed the theory of plasminogen deficiency and attempted supplementing plasminogen. Topical plasminogen preparations, extracted from fresh frozen plasma, have successfully been used in the treatment of LC. Using FFP bypasses, the need for plasminogen concentrate alone, which has a very short half-life and is difficult to have it readily available.\n\n\n\nCyclosporine A: Cyclosporine A had been the most promising element in the therapeutic management before plasminogen. \u00a0\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nOther measures: Based on the early observations of the presence of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells in ligneous tissue, topical medical regimens toward these non-specific findings were developed. Topical therapy including, topical hyaluronidase, heparin, azathioprine, alpha-chymotrypsin, sodium cromoglycate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and fibrinolysin have shown limited success.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tBecause trauma to the conjunctiva is likely to be an aetiological factor in LC, conjunctival surgery must be performed with utmost care.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nExcision of ligneous lesions: Systemic and topical plasminogen or FFP treatment is started to help soften the pseudo-membrane and facilitate removal. Complete excision with diathermy of the base of all ocular ligneous lesions is done. General anaesthesia may be used in adults with significant disease, and in all children. Failure to completely remove the lesion results in rapid recurrence, because the retained lesion acts as physical barrier to topical medical treatment.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tImmediately after surgery, the patient is continued on systemic and topical FFP, and started on a corticosteroid, broad-spectrum antibiotic and topical cyclosporine A. These medications are given after surgery, as early recurrence is the hallmark of this disorder.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tA small but significant amount of recurrence will be seen daily in every patient, and every recurrent lesion must be debrided daily. If abnormal tissue is allowed to collect for even 1 to 2 days, it will act as a barrier and prevent the topical medications from reaching the basal tissue, which is the origin of ligneous membranes.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tRepeat excision is conducted for the recurrent lesions.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Barbino and Rolando performed amniotic membrane transplantation for conjunctival reconstruction of LC. (Barabino S, Rolando M. Amniotic membrane transplantation in a case of ligneous conjunctivitis. Am J Ophthalmol 2004; 137: 752-753)\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tSurgical intervention may be needed to relieve obstruction in patients with congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tThe prognosis for ligneous conjunctivitis is variable and is based upon the extent, length and the affected site producing symptoms. It depends on the ability to control inflammation and recurrence of pseudo-membranes. Patients with corneal involvement have poorer visual prognosis.\n\n\tMany patients have lived into adulthood. Many patients experienced significant morbidity, including loss of function of an affected organ, such as loss of sight or loss of dentition.\n\n\tSystemic involvement of respiratory tract (tracheo-bronchial lesions) with pseudo-membranes may be life threatening due to respiratory failure. This group of patients are in need of specific therapy that treat and prevent these lesions and the sequelae thereof.\n\n\tThe quality of life of untreated patients with significant disease is not optimal.", "complications":"Ligneous conjunctivitis may lead to complications like:\n\n\n\t\tRecurrence of disease on withdrawal of the topical medicine.\n\n\t\tRecurrence of disease after surgical excision.\n\n\t\tNeovascularisation of cornea.\n\n\t\tScarring of cornea.\n\n\t\tCorneal perforation.\n\n\t\tCorneal infections.\n\n\t\tLoss of vision.\n\n\t\tAmblyopia in children.", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":169, "name":"Otitis Media", "intro":"Vision\u00a0is the special sense by which the qualities of an object (as colour, luminosity, shape, and size) constituting its appearance are perceived through a process in which light rays entering the eye are transformed by the retina(light sensitive inner layer of eyeball) into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve .\n\nVisual acuity\u00a0is a measure of resolution of the visual processing system. It is measured commonly with an eye chart e.g. Snellen chart. \u00a0A common Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. In visual acuity testing on Snellen chart, person normally sits at a distance of 6 meters from the chart on which letters of standard decreasing size are there in rows. Top line has a single letter which should be readable at a distance of 60 meters. Visual acuity is recorded as a ratio with numerator of 6 (distance at which patient sits.) and the denominator of the smallest possible size being read by the patient. For example, a vision record of 6/60 means that patient sitting at 6 meters could read letter in top line only , which should normally be read at 60 meters. Instead of distances being in meters, it may also be measured in feet. 6 meters is about 20 feet. Therefore, a vision of 6/6 in meters, is equivalent to a vision of 20/20 in feet. Similarly, a vision of 6/60 in meters, is equal to 20/200 in feet.\n\n\t\tTypical Snellen chart to estimate visual acuity:\u00a0Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLow vision\u00a0was defined as \u2018Visual acuity of 6/18 down to and including 3/60 in the better eye\u2019. A person with low vision is \u2018someone who, after medical, surgical and/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of \u00a0\u00a0<6/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of\u00a0 \u00a0<20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.\u2019 Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10th\u00a0revision of the International classification of the diseases (ICD-10 version: 2015), the term low vision is replaced by terms\u00a0\u2018moderate\u00a0visual impairment(presenting visual acuity of\u00a0 \u00a0<6/18 to 6/60)\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018severe visual\u00a0impairment\u00a0(presenting visual acuity of \u00a0\u00a0<6/60 to 3/60)\u2019, from all causes.\n\n\t\t\u2018 Vision 2020: the Right\u00a0 to Sight\u2019 is a partnership between World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Agency for the prevention of Blindness(IAPB), had been launched in 1999 with the twin aims of eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and preventing the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment between 1990 and 2020 . VISION 2020 advocates for increased awareness of the need for low vision services. Low vision services are aimed at people who have residual vision that can be used and enhanced by specific aids.

Though treated surgically, few associated with ocular diseases may benefit with Low vision aids.\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 In Diabetes, due to hypoxia ( less oxygen supply to retina ), there are vascular changes leading to haemorrhages (bleeding) and exudates ( leaks from vessel ). These changes in Macula may produce diminution of vision.\n\nGlaucoma\u00a0\u2013 In Glaucoma, there is rise in intraocular pressure leading to damage to the optic nerve and diminution of vision.\n\nRetinal Detachment\u00a0\u2013 Retina may separate from its underlying layer and leads to diminution of vision.\n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0 An inherited disease, usually affects peripheral vision to begin with, leads to night blindness.\n\nRetinopathy of Prematurity\u00a0\u2013Retinal vessels are not fully developed in premature infants. Premature infants are kept on oxygen in incubator.

Low vision aids improve the reading capability and speed of reading. Visual aids for distance are less practical than those for near.\n\n\t\t\tAccurate refraction and appropriate illumination should be ensured for optimal retinal image.\n\n\t\t\tMagnification is the basis of most techniques used in low vision clinic. There are three methods of enlarging the retinal image :-\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBy bringing the object nearer to the eye.\n\n\t\t\t\tBy magnification of the retinal image.\n\n\t\t\t\tBy increasing the size of the object to be viewed.\n\n\n\t\t\tBringing the object nearer to the eye, leads to larger visual angle being subtended at the eye.\n\n\t\t\tMagnification, \u00a0though increases the size of retinal image, leads to diminished visual field and reduced depth of focus. Due to this, lighting should be ample and directed on the fixation area.

The hand-held magnifier design involves a handle that is attached to a plus lens through which the user views an object. Since user must support the weight of magnifier, hand-held magnifiers are helpful for short term spotting task, like reading a prescription bottle or a price tag. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers with a variety of lens designs \u00a0e.g. \u00a0aspheric , aplanatic , biconvex , and diffractive lens.\n\nImage in Wikipedia(link is external).\n\nStand Magnifiers\u00a0\u00a0:- Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Stand Magnifiers are good for extended, near tasks such as reading a book, newspaper or magazine and making small notes. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers. There are around-the- neck\u00a0 magnifiers , for jobs which require both hands to be free, like sewing and knitting.\n\n\t\t\tSome magnifiers may use variations like :\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCombination of lenses are also extensively used in magnifiers e.g. Hastings triplet magnifier.\n\n\t\t\t\tStepped lenses introduced by Fresnel can also be used as magnifiers. One type is essentially a plastic sheet with concentric ridges forming a series of prisms of increasing power from the axis to the periphery and has the great advantage of eliminating the thickness and marked aberration that would be unavoidable in a single large lens with a continuous surface.\n\n\nMagnifying Reading Glasses\u00a0:- Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses. These may be having constant power or are progressive to be used for varying reading distances . These may be of illuminated type, which can be used in the dark.\n\nSpectacle Magnifiers\u00a0:-\u00a0 Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have \u2018 hands free\u2019. These may be:\n\n\n\t\t\t\tClip\u2013 on system :- \u00a0To be worn over the glasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tPrismatic eye wear :- \u00a0Prisms are incorporated in spectacle to aid monocular or binocular vision. These may be bifocal, with normal reading power in upper part, and prismatic high power in the lower part for reading fine print.\n\n\t\t\t\tNoves spectacle magnifier :-\u00a0 It uses diffractive lenses which are much thinner than the lenses of similar power.\n\n\t\t\t\tSpectacle microscope magnifiers :- \u00a0Have lenses of greater power than a traditional lens which forms a microscopic system when mounted on a spectacle lens. By holding the object closer, it allows an increase sized \u00a0image with large field of view and clarity.\n\n\nTelescopes\u00a0:-\u00a0 Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance ( near, intermediate or far ) and for any duration of time ( short term or long term ). Telescopes may be monocular or binocular, focusable or fixed-focus, hand-held or spectacle mounted.\n\nTechnical\u00a0 Magnifier\u00a0:-\u00a0 Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers.\n\n\t\t\tHigh power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle. This is called a Loupe. These may be monocular loupe e.g. jewellers\u2019 and watchmakers\u2019 loupes or binocular.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLoupe :\u00a0Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\n\n\t\t\t\tBinocular dental loupes:\u00a0Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\n\n\n\t\t\tAplanatic system of lenses such as exemplified in ophthalmic loupe, diminishes distortion of images.\n\nLamp Magnifiers\u00a0:-\u00a0 Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination. These are good for extended near to intermediate tasks that need both magnification and illumination in a hands-free design.\n\nNON- OPTICAL DEVICES\u00a0:- Increasing the size of the object to be viewed helps in approach to low vision e.g. Large-size telephone bills or large-size print books. The benefits of optical devices, may be enhanced by non-optical means, such as improving light or reducing glare.\n\nFlexible-Arm Task Lamps\u00a0:-\u00a0 Flexible-arm task lamps can be adjusted to a variety of tasks by providing proper light.\n\nFull Spectrum Light Bulbs\u00a0:-\u00a0 Full spectrum light bulbs provide full range of colours found in sunlight, and hence more natural light. A sunscreen may be needed for longer duration of work, just as working out door in sunlight.\n\nAbsorptive Sun lenses/Sun glasses\u00a0:- \u00a0\u00a0Absorptive sun lenses filter out ultraviolet and infrared light. These are helpful in bright light , reduce glare and increase contrast.\n\nColoured Acetate Sheets\u00a0z-\u00a0 Coloured acetate sheets, especially yellow or marigold, when placed on the page, can enhance contrast between the print and background, making words and letters appear darker and easier to read.\n\nNON- MAGNIFYING VISUAL AIDS\u00a0:-\n\nStenopaeic Hole\u00a0:- Stenopaeic hole is useful in any error of refraction or where the transparency of the ocular media is at fault. It is useful to a presbyope to read or write in an emergency.\n\n\t\t\t\u00a0As a stenopaeic slit, it may protect against ultraviolet radiation reflected from the snow.\n\n\t\t\t\u00a0As a reading slit cut in dark cardboard or plastic material, when placed immediately over print, may help patients with early lens opacities. In such cases, reflected light from the page is decreased and the contrast is thereby increased, allowing greater clarity in reading.\n\nELECTRONIC DEVICES\u00a0:-\n\nVideo Magnifiers\u00a0:-\u00a0 Video magnifiers use video cameras to project a magnified image onto a video monitor , a television (TV ) screen, or a computer monitor. Video magnifiers use stand-mounted or hand-held video cameras and are also called \u2018closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems\u2019. Apart from the undistorted magnification, CCTV offers two other advantages. The polarity may be reversed, allowing the print to be offered as white on black, the contrast is found helpful by some patients. It is possible to isolate one line of print, which may make it more intelligible.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHand-held video magnifiers rest against the reading material and generally have a small integrated display. Some hand-held magnifiers can project magnified image on a television.\n\n\t\t\t\tStand-mounted like Desktop video magnifiers have a table surface on which the object is placed. Above the object, is a camera and monitor upon which the magnified image is projected.\n\n\nNewer Technologies\u00a0:-\u00a0 Advances in consumer electronics is improving quality of life for people with low vision. Digital devices and apps offer options for portable, lower-cost low vision aids.\n\nE- readers\u00a0- The iPad and other electronic- readers are portable, and allow the user to adjust the font size and contrast setting. They have text-to-speech functionality and can read aloud to the user. E-readers do not offer the same level of magnification as CCTVs.\n\nSmartphones and Tablets\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0Both Apple and Android based smartphones and tablets offer a range of apps and built-in functions to help people with low vision.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMagnify, \u00a0iRead and iLoupe use camera of device, and light source to magnify and illuminate text.\n\n\t\t\t\tSightBook app digitally communicate your vision changes to your ophthalmologist by measuring your visual function with a set of near vision tests.\n\n\t\t\t\tMapquest app provides voice-guided directions and tells the driver when to turn.\n\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nLimitations of Low Vision Services\u00a0\u00a0:-\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\t\tProvision of low vision services is generally not favoured by eye-care providers because of the low economic gain.\n\n\t\tThe need for low vision services is often not fully recognised, owing to inadequate data.\n\n\t\tThere is little evidence for the cost-effectiveness of low vision care interventions.\n\n\t\tPersons with low vision are often unaware that they can be helped.\n\n\t\tIn some, there may be lack of encouragement on the part of the tester; in others, there may be poor motivation on the part of the patient.\n\n\t\tSome patient may feel that forcing himself to see may accelerate a deterioration of his condition.\n\n\t\tCommunication and referral between eye-care, special education, rehabilitation and low vision services are often inadequate.\n\n\t\tPlanning for low vision services is inadequate.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"There is no primary preventive measure for this disease as it is often inherited.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":170, "name":"Ocular Graft-versus-host Disease", "intro":"Lid imbrication syndrome refers to abnormality of lid apposition in which upper eyelid overrides the lower eyelid. This causes lower eyelid lashes and keratinised epithelium to rub chronically against the upper eyelid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. This leads to keratinisation of the upper eyelid margin and metaplasia of the distal tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting abnormal distal superior palpebral surface, in turn, irritates the underlying corneal surface on blinking and prohibits normal replenishment of the tear film. There are symptoms of dryness due to poor tear film being produced by disruption in tear film mechanics. It may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects.\n\n\tThis condition as a cause of chronic conjunctivitis was initially described by Karesh and others (1993). This disorder may have some overlap with floppy eyelid syndrome.\n\n\tBecause the upper eyelid overlies the lower eyelid, visualisation of eyelid apposition during closure of eyes may be difficult, and hence, this disorder may be missed. Many patients may be misdiagnosed as a case of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nMannis Mark J, Holland Edward J.

Distribution of the punctate epithelial keratopathy depends upon the position of cornea during sleep in patients with nocturnal lagophthalmos.\n\n\tExternal examination for complete eyelid closure should be done with patient gently closing the eyes.\n\n\tAcute seventh intracranial nerve dysfunction, due to Bell\u2019s palsy, trauma, or iatrogenic injury, may cause lagophthalmos. In cases with subtle orbicularis oculi muscle weakness, manual distraction of the eyelids during forced closure may expose weakness that may cause nocturnal lagophthalmos or incomplete blink.\n\n\tIt is important to check corneal sensation to rule out any component of fifth intracranial nerve dysfunction.\n\n\tThe vertical dimension of upper and lower eyelid skin must be evaluated in patients with suspected lagophthalmos. In the lower eyelids, vertical shortage will be apparent usually and will manifest as \u2018sclera show\u2019 and eyelid retraction.

Patients who cannot have decompression may be helped by lid lengthening procedures in an attempt to reposition the eyelids anteriorly to the corneal apex during closure of eyes. Patients with retro-bulbar mass or haemorrhage require removal or drainage of the retro-bulbar lesion.\n\nLid shortening: Lagophthalmos due to trauma or iatrogenic shortening of the upper eyelids usually require reconstructive soft tissue surgery.\n\nInadequate vertical skin: Lagophthalmos due to inadequate vertical skin requires replacement with skin flaps or grafts.\n\nSymblepharon: Lagophthalmos due to eyelid-globe adhesion by symblepharon are treated by releasing the symblepharon and reconstructing the appropriate fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) with mucous membrane grafting.\n\nParalysis of orbicularis oculi muscle: Measures to reduce evaporation and increase lubrication may be sufficient with limited exposure keratopathy of anticipated short duration. If exposure is severe or anticipated to be long lasting, tarsorrhaphy may be done.\n\nLower lid retraction: Patients with paralytic lower eyelid laxity and ectropion are best managed by placing a spacer to elevate and support the lid.

 {"id":172, "name":"Osteoarthritis", "intro":"Lead poisoning is one of the most common diseases of toxic environmental origin and accounts for about 0.6% of the global burden of disease. Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the earth\u2019s crust. \u00a0It is soft, malleable, and melts at a relatively low temperature. It is easily moulded and can be combined with other metals to form alloys.\n\n\tIt is widely used in many products such as lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles, pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, and toys and in some cosmetics and traditional medicines.\n\n\tMining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling activities, and the continued use of leaded paint, leaded gasoline, and leaded aviation fuel (in some countries) are important sources responsible for environmental contamination. Drinking water supplied through lead pipes or pipes joined with lead solder may contain lead. Widespread use of lead has resulted in to extensive environmental contamination and health problems in many parts of the world. Humans also suffer from lead intoxication through the food chain.\n\n\tLead is a cumulative toxicant (increasing in quantity in the body over many years) that affects multiple body systems (neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems).\u00a0Young children are more susceptible to toxic effects of lead and can suffer with permanent adverse effects on their health. Adults exposed to lead are at increased risk of developing high blood pressure and kidney damage. Exposure of pregnant women to high levels of lead can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight and malformations.\n\n\tLead has no essential role in the human body. No safe level of lead exposure has so far been established. Even blood lead concentrations as low as 5 \u00b5g/dl may result in decreased intelligence in children, behavioural difficulties and learning problems; therefore prevention from exposure is important. The phasing-out of lead from petrol is a major international public health achievement but still global consumption of lead is increasing because of increasing demand for energy-efficient vehicles.\n\n\tLead paint can cause a long-lasting hazard to health in all age groups. Since leaded paint is a continuing source of exposure in many countries, World Health Organization (WHO), along with the United Nations Environment Programme has formed the \u201cGlobal Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint\u201d. Its broad objective is to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead and eventually to eliminate the risks involved with such paints.\n\n\tThe Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), Government of India has passed a notification in November 2016 as \u201cRegulation on Lead contents in Household and Decorative Paints Rules, 2016\" and has prohibited manufacture, trade, import as well as export of household and decorative paints containing lead or lead compounds in excess of 90 parts per million (ppm).

Secondary prevention strategies work to reduce the effects of lead in patients with identified elevated blood lead levels (EBLL\u2019s).\n\n\tWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme jointly initiated the \u201cGlobal Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint\u201d to achieve international goals to prevent children\u2019s exposure to lead from paints containing lead and to minimize occupational exposures to lead paint. Its broad objective is to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead. International Lead Poisoning Prevention Week provides an opportunity to mobilize political and social commitment for further progress.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), Government of India has also prohibited manufacture, trade, import as well as export of household and decorative paints containing lead or lead compounds in excess of 90 parts per million (ppm) with a notification as \u201cRegulation on Lead contents in Household and Decorative Paints Rules, 2016\u2019 passed in November 2016.\n\nHealth tips to prevent lead exposure-\n\n\n\t\tWomen should be counseled about effects of pica during pregnancy.\n\n\t\tChildren should get a healthy diet sufficient in Iron, calcium and vitamin C and should get four to six small meals during the day.\n\n\t\tTake shoes off at the door. Lead can be brought into the living space from outside areas on shoes.\n\n\t\tHand washing is a simple yet very effective preventive measure, especially during a young child\u2019s crawling and hand to mouth stage.\n\n\t\tProvide (lead) safe toys and items to infants and toddlers.\n\n\t\tChild play area and toys should be cleaned regularly.\n\n\t\tIf a family\u2019s home has lead pipes, use initial water from pipes for other purposes (watering plants or flush toilets) before the first morning use.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nenvfor.nic.in/sites/default/files/gazete%20notification_%20lead%20in%20paints.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/ipcs/lead_campaign/ILPPW_2016_Report.pdf?ua=1\n\nwww.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health/gaelp_leg_control/en/\n\nchfs.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/103397BE-C0EB-43AA-88E4-", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

If a mosquito bites a person infected with malaria, it can also become infected and spread the parasite on to others. During the bite of female mosquitoes, the half matured parasite transmits from the saliva of the mosquitoes into the small blood vessels (circulatory system) of the human through a special body part of the mosquitoes called as Proboscis. The parasite enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver.\u00a0 In the blood, the parasites travel to the liver cell and there they mature and reproduce. The infection develops in the liver before re-entering the bloodstream and invading the red blood cells. The parasites grow and multiply in the red blood cells. At regular intervals, the infected blood cells burst, releasing more parasites into the blood. Infected blood cells usually burst every 48 to 72 hours.

It is associated with nausea or vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to bright light and loud sounds, with a strong desire to lie down in a darkened room. This stage lasts for four to 72 hours.\n\nResolution stage: Most attacks gradually fade away. Some people find the headache stops suddenly after they have been sick.

A normal ECG does not rule out acute myocardial infarction.\n\n\n\tErrors in interpretation are relatively common, and the failure to identify high risk features has a negative effect on the quality of patient care.\n\nCardiac markers\n\tCardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. The markers most widely used in detection of MI are the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac troponins T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4\u20136 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires two out of three components (history, ECG, and enzymes). When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time.\n\nAngiography\n\tTo restore blood flow, coronary angiography can be performed. A catheter is inserted into an artery (usually the femoral artery) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. A radio-opaque dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and angioplasty applied as a therapeutic measure. Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in interventional cardiology.\n\nExercise stress test\n\tMeasures heart rate while patient walks on a treadmill. This helps to determine how well heart is working when it has to pump more blood.\n\nDoppler test\n\tA Doppler test uses reflected sound waves to see how blood flows through a blood vessel. It helps doctors evaluate blood flow through major arteries and veins, such as those of the arms, legs, and neck. It can show blocked or reduced blood flow through narrowing in the major arteries of the neck that may cause infarction.\n\n\tNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

The catheter is passed through blood vessels and up to heart, over a fine guide wire, using X-rays to guide it, before being moved into the narrowed section of coronary artery. Once in position, the balloon is inflated inside the narrowed part of the artery to open it wide. A stent (flexible metal mesh) is usually inserted into the artery to help keep it open afterwards.\n\nThrombolysis:\n\tThrombolysis involves giving injections which contain thrombolytics. Thrombolytics target and destroy a substance called fibrin. Fibrin is a tough protein that makes up blood clots by acting like a sort of fibre mesh that hardens around the blood.

 {"id":181, "name":"Parkinson's Disease", "intro":"Mooren\u2019s Ulcer is a painful, progressive, and chronic disease of the cornea, which often is bilateral and may cause severe vision loss or even loss of the eye. It is characterised by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown aetiology. The disease generally begins with intense limbal inflammation and swelling in episclera and conjunctiva. Corneal changes begin 2- 3mm from the limbus as grey swelling that rapidly furrows. It affects superficial one- third of cornea and then it progresses circumferentially and centrally. There is usually infiltration and undermining of the leading edge of the circumferential peri-limbal ulceration. The bed of the furrow becomes vascularised with vessels advancing into the base of the undermined edges. The central edges of the ulcer can develop an overhanging edge extending from limbus into the ulcer bed, with or without opacification and neovascularisation. Neovascularisation may occur up to the advancing edge of the ulcer but not beyond it. Tissue destruction and ulceration of the cornea is initially confined to the periphery, but it may progress in some patients to involve the entire cornea. Destruction of the cornea generally affects stromal tissue only, leaving behind an intact epithelium and endothelium. The ulcers are crescent- shaped and may leave behind either an opaque oedematous cornea or is replaced with a thin fibro-vascular membrane. It does not affect underlying Descemet\u2019s membrane. There is no associated scleral inflammation. Intense pain is a hallmark of Mooren\u2019s ulcer, which is generally lacking in other peripheral ulcerative keratitis. The disease may be refractory to all forms of available therapy.\n\nBowman (1849) first described what we now call Mooren\u2019s ulcer of the cornea (also known as chronic serpiginous ulcer and ulcus rodens). Mooren\u2019s ulcer as a clinical entity was first described in detail by Mooren (1867).\n\nWood and Kaufman (1971) postulated that there are two distinct populations of patients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer. These two clinical types of primary Mooren\u2019s ulcer are:\n\n\nType I: The limited type is typically unilateral, not associated with significant pain, and occurs in older patients (fourth decade and older). It is more responsive to local medical and surgical therapy.\n\nType II: Relentless, progressive type is more resistant to systemic immune-suppression. It is painful, bilateral and causes relentless, progressive destruction of the cornea, usually in younger individuals (third decade), many of whom are of African descent. It may progress to corneal perforation.\n\n\n\tHowever, the categorisation described by Wood and Kaufman has been refuted by Lewallen S and Courtright P (1990).\n\nReferences:\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.

Supportive evidence includes:\n\n\n\t\tPresence of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the conjunctiva adjacent to the ulcer.\n\n\t\tSerum of patients shows circulating antibodies to conjunctival and corneal epithelium.\n\n\t\tElevation of serum levels of immunogobulin (Ig) like IgA, IgG and IgM and lymphocytes sensitised to saline- soluble corneal antigen.\n\n\t\tIncreased antibody levels to a cornea- specific stromal protein antigen.\n\n\t\tIncreased helper T cell to suppressor T cell ratio.\n\n\t\tFavourable response to immunosuppressive agents in some patients.\n\n\t\tPresence of Calgranulin C, a unique cornea associated protein that is present in the cornea and is the target of auto-antibodies from patients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer. This calcium- binding protein is identical to a neutrophil protein found on the surface of filarial nematodes. Recognition of this complex on a filarial nematode is suspected to lead to autoimmunity to the cornea in patients with persistent parasitic infection resulting in Mooren\u2019s ulcer.\n\n\n\tMooren\u2019s ulcer may represent a final common pathway to a variety of insults to the cornea in susceptible patients. Trauma or infection may alter normal corneal antigens, which may lead to an autoimmune response. The cornea is damaged further, liberating altered corneal antigens that aggravate and perpetuate the process until the corneal stroma is completely destroyed.\n\n\tCertain conditions may be associated with Mooren\u2019s ulcer:\n\n\n\t\tAlkali injuries.\n\n\t\tTrauma.\n\n\t\tHerpes simplex infection.\n\n\t\tHerpes zoster infection.\n\n\t\tParasitic infections.\n\n\t\tCataract surgery.\n\n\t\tCorneal surgery.\n\n\n\tIn the past, Mooren\u2019s ulcer has been related to:\n\n\n\t\tMalnutrition.\n\n\t\tMetabolic disorder.\n\n\t\tTrophic disturbances involving the trigeminal cranial nerve.\n\n\t\tDeficiency of vitamin B1.\n\n\n\tSome patients have been identified who have an underlying chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus infection. This infection should be excluded because it alters therapy and the potential outcome of treatment.\n\n\tThe majority of the cases, however, appear to be idiopathic and the disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion.", "diagnosis":"By definition, primary Mooren\u2019s ulcer is not associated with any systemic abnormality, except for the occasional association with hepatitis C. It is not associated with scleritis, which distinguishes it from other more common types of peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with collagen vascular disease. Patients having other systemic disease including leukaemia, pyoderma gangrenosum and syphilis may also develop peripheral ulcerative keratitis. This classic idiopathic variety may manifest as either type I or type II.\n\n\tA secondary Mooren\u2019s ulcer like peripheral ulcerative keratitis may occur following other types of corneal inflammation, including trauma, cataract surgery, herpes simplex, herpes zoster and chemical injury with alkalis. Although these are not diagnostic of true Mooren\u2019s ulcer, they do support the involvement of an altered auto-antigen pathogenic mechanism. This is often unilateral and behaves clinically like type I.\n\n\tA small group of patients with aggressive disease progression are seropositive for hepatitis C.\n\nDiagnosis of Mooren\u2019s ulcer depends upon medical history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Laboratory investigations are required to exclude other systemic diseases.\n\nClinical features:\n\n\tMooren\u2019s ulcer is characterised by a progressive, crescentic, peripheral corneal ulceration which is slightly towards the center from the corneoscleral limbus. It is associated with a characteristic undermined overhanging edge. It typically progresses with an anterior, stromal, yellow- white infiltrate at the advancing margin. An overlying epithelial defect then may develop. The ulcer progresses both circumferentially and centrally. Progressive stromal melting affects first the deeper and subsequently the anterior stroma. Following stromal melting, a re-epithelialised, conjunctivalised, scarred and thinned cornea remains. \u00a0Patients with minimal stroma left may be predisposed to perforation either spontaneously or following minimal trauma.\n\n\tIn aggressive form of Mooren\u2019s ulcer, inflammation may affect the entire cornea and perilimbal tissue. The cornea may perforate. It may have associated cataract, secondary glaucoma and uveitis.\n\nChronic Mooren\u2019s ulcer ultimately results in central area of hazy stromal tissue with severe peripheral thinning. There is no scleral involvement, but associated conjunctival and episcleral inflammation may be present. There is no lucid interval (clear zone between ulcer and limbus). Scarring is common and it may be associated with irregular corneal astigmatism.\n\nCorneal topography: Corneal topography shows peripheral steepening and severe irregular corneal astigmatism.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSrinivasan and colleagues (2007) described three patterns of corneal ulceration:\n\n\nPartial peripheral ulceration: Partial peripheral ulceration may be sub-divided into nasal, temporal, superior and inferior ulceration. Nasal and temporal involvement is more common.\n\nComplete peripheral ulceration: In complete peripheral ulceration, the disease encompasses the corneal periphery, leaving behind a central island of cornea that is often opacified.\n\nTotal corneal ulceration: In total corneal ulceration, the stroma is completely replaced with a fibro-vascular membrane.\n\n\nWatson and colleagues (1997) classified the disease into three types based on clinical features, anterior segment fluorescein angiographic findings, and treatment response:\n\n\nUnilateral Mooren\u2019s ulceration: Unilateral Mooren\u2019s ulceration is excessively painful and occurs in elderly. Affected eyes are red but inflammation does not extend beyond 3mm from the limbus. Ulceration extends around the globe and often leaves an opaque central cornea. The central corneal stroma is eventually removed. Anterior segment fluorescein angiography shows venular occlusion of local episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels along with disruption of the limbal arcade and vascular leakage from deep vessels at the limbus and base of the ulcer. In addition, vaso- obliteration of superficial vascular networks is characteristic of unilateral Mooren\u2019s ulcer.\n\nBilateral aggressive Mooren\u2019s ulcer: Bilateral aggressive Mooren\u2019s ulcer occurs in younger patients and the pain is less severe. Grey patches occur in corneal stroma about 2mm from the edge of the limbus. These grey patches then aggregate and lead to a typical Mooren\u2019s ulcer that progress first circumferentially and then centrally. Fluorescein angiography shows vascular leakage and new vessel formation that reaches the base of the ulcer. Angiography may also show changes in episcleral vessels and blockage in addition to break-up of the limbal arcade.\n\nBilateral indolent Mooren\u2019s ulcer: Bilateral indolent Mooren\u2019s ulcer occurs in middle aged patients who exhibit corneal guttering in both eyes with little inflammation. Both eyes tend to be involved at presentation, but the disease is often more severe in one eye. Most cases are gradually progressive but some heal spontaneously. Vascular architecture is normal with the exception that new vessels may extend into the base of the ulcer.\n\n\n\tSince Mooren\u2019s ulcer is a clinical diagnosis, it is not necessary to conduct all investigations, if Watson\u2019s criteria is met.\n\nWatson\u2019s criteria:\n\n\n\t\tCrescent shaped peripheral corneal ulcer.\n\n\t\tExtensive undermining of the central edge of the ulcer.\n\n\t\tCorneal infiltrations along the leading edge.\n\n\t\tAbsence of scleritis.\n\n\t\tAbsence of detectable systemic disease.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nLaboratory investigations include:\n\nBlood examination: It includes complete and differential blood cell count including platelet counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\n\nSerology: It includes measurement of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.\n\n\tIn addition, certain tests like measurement of liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, serum protein electrophoresis and urinalysis may also be required.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPathology:\n\n\tIn Mooren\u2019s ulcer, three zones of corneal involvement have been described.\n\n\nSuperficial stroma: Superficial stroma contains plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, neovascular elements and disrupted collagen lamellae.\n\nMidstroma: Midstroma shows an increase in number of fibroblasts.\n\nDeep stroma: Deep stroma is infiltrated primarily by macrophages. The epithelial basement membrane is disrupted at the leading edge and the infiltrate contains primarily neutrophils.\n\n\nConjunctiva: Conjunctival resections show mononuclear infiltrate in the substantia propria, which contains plasma cells, histiocytes and eosinophils.\n\n\tThe presence of tissue- fixed auto-antibodies and complement also has been reported in the epithelial basement membrane of the cornea and conjunctiva.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\tMooren\u2019s ulcer is a rare disease. The differential diagnosis includes other inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions causing peripheral thinning such as:\n\n\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration: Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory peripheral corneal thinning disorder that is usually bilateral, superior, and not associated with significant pain or inflammation unless there is an associated episcleritis or superficial scleritis. The corneal epithelium remains intact and the disease slowly progresses in circumferential manner without involving central cornea.\n\nPellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration causes inferior corneal thinning and irregular against-the-rule astigmatism but lacks the inflammation and pain seen in Mooren\u2019s ulcer.\n\nSenile furrow degeneration: Senile furrow degeneration causes thinning between the limbus and the arcus in elderly patients. However, no inflammation or vascularisation occurs.\n\nPeripheral marginal keratitis (catarrhal ulcer): Peripheral marginal keratitis (catarrhal ulcer), seen in association with staphylococcal blepharitis, may also show peripheral infiltrates. The infiltrate is usually unilateral and is separated from the limbus by a lucid interval (a clear zone). Associated pain is not severe. The disease has a benign course, and is self- limited.\n\nCollagen vascular diseases: Collagen vascular diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, may also be associated with peripheral corneal infiltrates and ulcers with features similar to Mooren\u2019s ulcer and an associated scleritis. The characteristic marginal furrows of rheumatoid arthritis are located about 1mm within the limbus and usually bilaterally in the inferior cornea. It may be superficial and nonprogressive, or it may progress to epithelial breakdown, marked stromal thinning with formation of descemetocele, and finally perforation. The marginal furrows may encircle the cornea. Occasionally, the entire superficial part of the remaining central corneal stroma may slough away.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tThe objective and goal of therapy of Mooren\u2019s ulcer is to stop the progression of the ulcerative process and promote re- epithelialisation of the ulcerated area. Symptoms of pain and photophobia and inflammatory signs of conjunctival hyperaemia and oedema generally disappear shortly after healing is complete.\n\nBrown and Mondino (1984) suggested a stepladder approach that includes topical corticosteroids, conjunctival resection, and systemic immunosuppressives.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nTopical corticosteroids: To begin with, patients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer are treated with topical corticosteroids, as long as there is no sign or danger of imminent perforation. The frequency of topical steroids may be slowly tapered, if the ulcer heals completely. Aggressive therapy with topical corticosteroids may be effective in unilateral and bilateral non simultaneous cases, but not treated aggressively in bilateral simultaneous cases. Topical steroids must be used with extreme caution in patients having associated rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n\tPatients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer are prescribed antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection, and cycloplegics to control pain from spasm of the ciliary body.\n\n\nSystemic immunosuppressives: Systemic immunosuppressives may be employed in patients with bilateral and progressive disease, and also where conjunctival excision does not result in total healing of ulcer. If healing does not occur after one or two months, immunosuppressive therapy is slowly decreased and then discontinued. If some healing is observed, the medication is continued until complete healing. The dosage of the treatment is titrated to maintain haemoglobin and blood counts. Common immunosuppressive drugs used are cyclophosphamide, azathioprine with or without steroids, and methotrexate. Some treat Mooren\u2019s ulcer with systemic and topical cyclosporine A. The efficacy of topical cyclosporine is attributed to local depression of ocular immune-pathologic reaction.\n\n\n\tSystemic immunosuppressives may also be used for peripheral corneal ulcers associated with collagen vascular diseases. Systemic immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, have been effective in the treatment of scleritis and ulcerative keratitis. Cytotoxic agents may improve long- term survival.\n\n\tSystemic immunosuppression would likely be contraindicated in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection, so it is important to exclude it beforehand.\n\n\nInterferon- \u03b12b: Recently, an association has been reported between Mooren\u2019s ulcer and hepatitis C infection. Some cases of bilateral ulcer that did not respond to conventional therapy showed improvement with systemic interferon- \u03b12b for the chronic active hepatitis.\n\nRebetron: Rebetron is a newer treatment option. It combines interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.\n\nTopical lecithinated superoxide dismutase: A novel experimental therapy with topical lecithinated superoxide dismutase limited tissue destruction in patients who failed to topical corticosteroid therapy.\n\n\n\tIn addition, bandage contact lenses may reduce discomfort and promote epithelial healing. Subconjunctival heparin injections and topical collagenase inhibitors have also been used.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\nConjunctival resection: Conjunctival resection may be performed adjacent to the ulcer in patients who show incomplete or no response to topical corticosteroids. About 3mm of conjunctiva is resected from the corneoscleral limbus and adjacent to the corneal ulcer. The epithelium in the bed of ulcer and less than 0.2mm of corneal epithelium central to the ulcer are removed by simple debridement.\n\nCryotherapy: Cryotherapy of the conjunctiva adjacent to the affected cornea. It gives similar results as are obtained with conjunctival excision.\n\nTissue adhesives (isobutyl- cyanoacrylate): Tissue adhesives (isobutyl- cyanoacrylate) may be applied if the corneal perforation is less than 1mm in size. There may be an arrest of ulceration if the application is done at an early stage before corneal perforation. The adhesive rapidly polymerises and becomes a solid adhesive on contact with water.\n\nKeratoplasty: Keratoplasty may be required when the corneal perforation is too large for tissue adhesive to seal and prevent the leak.\n\n\n\t- \u00a0Patch graft: Patch graft may range from a tapered plug of corneal tissue to a peripheral penetrating keratoplasty. A small piece of corneal tissue is crafted into a tapering plug to fill the defect. The margins of the perforation site are cleaned of any necrotic material and epithelial tissue.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0Partial penetrating keratoplasty: Partial penetrating keratoplasty may be performed in cases with larger peripheral perforations.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty shows poor results and has been described for patients with healed Mooren\u2019s ulcer. Penetrating keratoplasty may be complicated by the recurrence and extension of the disease process into the donor tissue with resultant necrosis and sloughing. Penetrating keratoplasty may restore some vision in a healed and quiet eye with an opaque or scarred cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0Crescentic annular lamellar graft: Crescentic annular lamellar graft is rarely used in cases of peripheral corneal thinning, when the cornea is not perforated.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0Central lamellar keratectomy: Some advocate removal of the presumed antigenic corneal stroma by central lamellar keratectomy, in an attempt to mediate a more rapid resolution of the inflammation.\n\n\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation is an alternative treatment for reconstruction of ocular surface and corneal stroma damaged by an immunologic process. The exact mechanism of its function is not known but it has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti- immunogenic qualities. A single layer amniotic membrane transplantation involves placing amniotic membrane stromal side down onto the ulcerated defect. Multilayer amniotic membrane may be placed into a stromal ulcer defect.\n\nKeratoepithelioplasty: Keratoepithelioplasty is a new surgical procedure for the treatment of persistent epithelial defect in patients without healthy donor tissue in their fellow eyes. After a total superficial keratectomy, donor corneal lenticules covered by epithelium are placed at the corneoscleral limbus. The epithelium spreads from the lenticules and covers the center of the cornea.\n\nConjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap may provide comfort, reduce ocular inflammation, and promote healing in cases where medical/ surgical therapy fails, and patient experiences pain from recurrent epithelial breakdown with stromal ulceration. It is especially useful for elderly debilitated patients for whom prolonged hospitalisation and medical therapy may not be warranted.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tMost patients with unilateral disease respond fairly well to topical corticosteroids and conjunctival resection.\n\n\tThe prognosis is poor for more severe bilateral cases, and the primary goal is to reduce the chances of perforation and preserve the structure of the eye.", "complications":"Complications of Mooren\u2019s ulcer may be:\n\n\n\t\tUveitis.\n\n\t\tSecondary glaucoma.\n\n\t\tCataract.\n\n\t\tCorneal perforation.\n\n\t\tEnd- stage cornea is thinned and conjunctivalised.", "Prevention":"There are no specific preventive measures; however few known factors causing microcephaly during fetal life may be prevented as-\n\nBefore conception-\n\n\n\t\tIf Rubella Immunization (in the form of measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine) is not given during childhood, it should be given to female child and women of childbearing age (prior to conception).\n\n\t\tEarly diagnosis and management of certain infections (rubella, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes) in women who are planning to become pregnant.\n\n\t\tAdvise for avoidance of exposure to toxic substances such as smoking, alcohol.\n\n\t\tGenetic counseling if there is history of microcephaly in previous pregnancy.\n\n\t\tPersonal protective measures to protect themselves from bites of mosquito that transmit Zika virus.\n\n\t\tFor additional information to women in context of microcephaly and zika virus disease, click here\u00a0www.who.int\n\n\nDuring pregnancy-\n\n\n\t\tMothers should get proper antenatal care during pregnancy including advice on nutrition, screening and management of certain infections, periodic assessment of foetal growth.\n\n\t\tWomen who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should take extra care to protect themselves from the bites of the mosquitoes by\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tusing insect repellent: repellents may be applied to exposed skin or to clothing, and should contain DEET;\n\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible (e.g. long sleeves, long trousers or skirts);\n\n\t\t\t\tsleeping under mosquito nets, even when sleeping during the daytime;\n\n\t\t\t\tuse of mosquito mesh/nets/screens on windows and doors;\n\n\t\t\t\tuse of the above personal protection measures by individuals infected with Zika, dengue, and or chikungunya virus should be encouraged to avoid spread of infection to uninfected individuals (at least during the first week of onset of symptoms);\n\n\t\t\t\tto prevent potential sexual transmission of Zika virus, sexual partners of pregnant women, living in or returning from areas of ongoing Zika virus transmission, should use safer sexual practices (including correct and consistent condom use) or abstain from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy;\n\n\t\t\t\teliminating potential mosquito breeding sites, by emptying, cleaning or covering containers that can hold even small amounts of water, such as buckets, flower pots and tyres.\n\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0WHO has released a Decision-chart for the care of pregnant women living in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission on 2nd March 2016a.\n\n\nAfter birth-\n\n\n\t\tEarly interventions after child birth to promote physical and learning abilities in child.\n\n\t\tPsychological support for pregnant women and for families with microcephalyb.\n\n\nReferences-\n\n\ta.

 {"id":183, "name":"Pneumonia", "intro":"Myopia or short-sightedness is that type of refractive error where parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the light sensitive layer of retina with eyes in position of rest.\n\n\tThe term \u2018myopia\u2019 was introduced due to the habit of myopic people of half closing the eyelids while looking at distant objects, so that they may have the advantages of a stenopaeic slit (a black disc punctured with a fine slit or hole).\n\n\tRefractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.\n\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\n\n\tThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.\n\n\tPrevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

This is the commonest type.\n\nCurvature myopia: This produced by the increased curvature of the cornea, lens or both.\n\nPositional myopia: This is produced by the anterior placement of crystalline lens of the eye.\n\nIndex myopia: Index myopia is produced due to increase in the refractive index of crystalline lens due to nuclear sclerosis.\n\nMyopia due to excessive accommodation: This occurs in patients with spasm of accommodation.\n\n\nOptics\n\n\tImage of distant object consists of circles of diffusion formed by the divergent beam of light, since the parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the retinal layer.\n\n\tFar point of the myopic eye is a finite point in front of the retina. Due to this, near object situated at the far point is focussed on retina without an effort of accommodation.\n\n\tNodal point lies further away from retina in myopia. Thus, the image formed is appreciably larger than an emmetropic eye and in spectacle corrected eye.\n\n\tIn uncorrected myopia, accommodation is not developed normally, since they need not accommodate to see the near objects clearly. This results in convergence insufficiency, exophoria and early presbyopia.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon clinical features and retinoscopy.\n\nClinical types of myopia\n\nCongenital myopia: Congenital myopia is present since birth but is usually diagnosed by the age of about 2- 3 years. Mostly, it is unilateral and manifests as anisometropia. Rarely, it may be bilateral. It is usually produced due to increase in axial length of the eyeball. Refractive error is usually around 8- 10 D. It may be associated with\n\n\n\t\tPrematurity.\n\n\t\tMarfan\u2019s syndrome.\n\n\t\tHomocystinuria.\n\n\t\tCongenital convergent strabismus (squint).\n\n\t\tCongenital anomalies of eyes such as aniridia, cataract, microphthalmos (small eyeballs), megalocornea (large cornea), and congenital separation of retina.\n\n\n\tCongenital myopia may be associated with amblyopia and congenital convergent squint. In bilateral myopia, child show some noticeable difficulty in seeing distant objects and tend to hold things very close to the eyes.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSimple or developmental myopia: This is the commonest type and is also known as physiological or school myopia. It is not associated with any other disease of the eye. This results from biological variation in the development of eye. It may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive condition. Axial type may signify just a physiological variation in the length of the eyeball. Curvature type is considered to be due to underdevelopment of the eyeball.\n\n\tMost patients are born hypermetropic, but later become myopic with age. It usually begins around 7 to 10years of age and increases during the growing years. Besides visual symptoms, child may have signs such as\n\n\n\t\tLarge and prominent eyeballs.\n\n\t\tSlightly deeper anterior chamber.\n\n\t\tSlightly dilated pupils.\n\n\t\tFundus is usually normal. Rarely, there may be myopic crescent.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPathological or degenerative myopia: Pathological or degenerative myopia is a rapidly progressive refractive error resulting in high myopia during early adult life. It is usually associated with degenerative changes in the eye. It results from rapid axial growth of the eyeball. It may be linked with heredity or general growth process.\n\n\tPathological myopia results from rapid axial growth of the eyeball which does not fall within normal biological variations of development. Beside symptoms, patient show signs such as\n\n\n\t\tProminent large eyes due to elongation of posterior pole of eye.\n\n\t\tLarger cornea.\n\n\t\tDeep anterior chamber.\n\n\t\tSlightly larger pupils with sluggish reaction to light.\n\n\t\tLarge and pale optic disc with temporal myopic crescent. It may be peri-papillary (around optic disc) in some cases.\n\n\t\tSuper-traction crescent (retina being pulled over the disc margin) may be present on nasal side of optic disc.\n\n\t\tDegeneration of choroid and retina.\n\n\t\tFoster-Fuch\u2019s spots, as dark red circular patch due to sub-retinal neovascularisation and choroidal haemorrhage, may be present.\n\n\t\tAssociated lattice degeneration and/or snail track lesion may be present in the periphery of retina.\n\n\t\tRetinal tear, haemorrhage or retinal detachment may occur.\n\n\t\tPosterior staphyloma due to scleral ectasia at the posterior pole.\n\n\t\tVitreous degeneration.\n\n\t\tPosterior vitreous detachment seen as Weiss\u2019 reflex.\n\n\t\tContraction of visual fields and ring scotoma may be present.\n\n\t\tElectroretinography may reveal sub-normal electroretinogram due to chorio-retinal atrophy.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nAcquired myopia: Acquired myopia may be produced due to\n\n\nIndex myopia: It may be produced due to change in refractive index e.g. nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens.\n\nCurvature myopia: Increase in curvature of cornea or lens produces curvature myopia.\n\nPositional myopia: It may be produced by anterior subluxation of the crystalline lens.\n\nConsecutive myopia: It may be produced due to surgical overcorrection of hypermetropia or in pseudophakia with overcorrecting intraocular lens implants.\n\nPseudo-myopia or artificial myopia: This may be produced due to excessive accommodation and spasm of accommodation. Full hypermetropic correction in children may also lead to this.\n\nDrug induced myopia: Certain drugs such as pilocarpine, steroids or sulphonamides may also produce myopia.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical therapy\n\nVisual hygiene: This is important to avoid asthenopia. Proper posture and adequate illumination is required during close work.\n\nOptical therapy:\n\n\tAppropriate glasses/contact lenses may be used to provide clear retinal image.\n\n\tMinimum correcting power providing maximum vision is given.\n\nChildren: Myopia up to 6 D in children, especially younger than 8 years, should be fully corrected and are advised to wear glasses constantly. It helps in developing normal accommodation- convergence reflex. Myopia should never be over-corrected.\n\nAdults: Patients younger than 30 years, usually accept full correction. Patients over 30 years of age usually do not accept full correction, and are prescribed with glasses keeping power slightly under-corrected.\n\nHigh myopia: As little correction as compatible with good vision is prescribed. Under-correction also avoids minification of the image.\n\nOptical correction of eye includes\n\n\nSpectacle correction: Spectacle correction may be given, but it produces minification of object size and distortion of peripheral image in cases with high myopia.\n\nContact lenses: These are particularly useful in cases of high myopia. These avoid peripheral minification in size as well as peripheral distortion of image.\n\nLow vision and visual aids: Visual aids are indicated in patients with progressive myopia with retinal degenerative changes where useful vision may not be obtained with spectacles or contact lenses.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy includes:\n\n\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Keratomileusis refers to carving of cornea. Excimer laser ablation is applied directly to the corneal stroma after reflecting a lamellar or partial- thickness corneal flap. The flap is returned to its original position, once ablation is complete. Recovery of vision usually takes few days and some patients even take few weeks.\n\nWavefront- guided LASIK: Wave front- guided LASIK or custom LASIK is a new wave front technology to program ablation pattern more precisely than the conventional LASIK.\n\nIntraLASIK (IntraLase): IntraLASIK uses femtosecond laser, which is more accurate than a blade and provides a huge margin in terms of precision and safety. Femtosecond laser creates a corneal flap at a pre-programmed depth and position.\n\nEpiLASIK: EpiLASIK is designed to create a thin flap in the epithelium. It is an excellent alternative for patients with thin and steep or flat cornea. The layer is preserved and later replaced following reshaping of cornea using excimer laser.\n\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK): PRK also uses excimer laser to reshape cornea, but this procedure does not require lamellar flap. The laser is applied directly to the anterior stromal surface after removal of surface epithelium. A soft contact lens is prescribed after laser treatment. The corneal epithelium typically heals in about 4 to 7 days. Improvement of vision may take few weeks to several months.\n\nLaser sub-epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): It involves cleaving the epithelial sheet at the basement membrane with dilute alcohol, applying laser as in conventional PRK, and repositioning the epithelium afterward.\n\nRadial keratotomy (RK): In RK, spoke- like cuts radiating from central cornea at about 90% corneal depth were given to balloon the peripheral cornea. Although RK surgery was effective, the results were often unpredictable and led to overcorrection, with progressive hypermetropia. RK surgery was soon replaced by laser vision correction with the introduction of PRK.\n\nRefractive lens exchange (RLE): Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is a surgical procedure that may correct refractive error by removing and replacing the clear crystalline lens of the eye with intraocular lenses (IOLs). RLE is an option for high refractive errors, where laser vision correction is not an option.\n\nPhakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant: Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) may be implanted in front of and attached to the iris or is placed just behind the iris. Phakic IOL is an alternative to laser vision correction with keratorefractive surgery.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nContraindications to surgery:\n\n\n\t\tCorneal or anterior segment diseases such as keratitis, conjunctivitis or corneal ulcers.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis\n\n\tThe prognosis is good in simple myopia. The refractive error usually stabilises by the age of 21 years.\n\n\tIn pathological myopia, visual prognosis is always guarded. There is possibility of progressive visual loss due to degeneration. The retina is stretched and thin, which may lead to retinal detachment.", "complications":"Complications of myopia include\n\n\nComplicated cataract: Apparently due to abnormality in metabolism of lens.\n\nHaemorrhage: It is related to degenerative changes in vitreous and retina.\n\nRetinal tears: Breaks in retina occurs which may lead to retinal detachment.\n\nVitreous haemorrhage: It usually accompanies retinal tears. Choroidal haemorrhage may also leak into the vitreous.\n\nChoroidal haemorrhage and thrombosis: These may lead to severe visual loss and are quite common.", "Prevention":"Prevention:\n\n\tNo vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, however several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development.\n\n\n\t\tAnyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where dromedary camels and other animals are present should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing before and after touching animals, and should avoid contact with sick animals.\n\n\t\tPerson should avoid contact with camels, drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

However, the mumps can affect both adolescents and adults. Mumps virus is present throughout the world. It spreads by airborne droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and by direct contact with an infected person. In temperate climates the disease incidence is peak in winter and spring while in hot climates the disease may occur at any time of year. Many countries experience epidemics at intervals of 2\u20135 years. Humans are the only known host for mumps virus. It primarily affects the salivary glands and it is sometimes called infectious parotitis.\n\n\tIn countries where large-scale immunization against mumps has been implemented, disease incidence has dropped dramatically. Before introduction of mumps vaccine, annual incidences were ranging from 100\u20131000 cases/100000 population.\n\n\tIn India outbreaks and sporadic cases are reported throughout the year and from all regions of the country. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India, has reported about 45 outbreaks of mumps from the different parts of the country in 2016. Passive reporting of mumps cases is also done by Indian academy of pediatrics (IAP) through its web based infectious disease surveillance system (IDSurv).\n\n\tMumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. 121 countries or 62% countries of the world have included mumps vaccine in their routine schedule in the form of MMR vaccine.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/biologicals/vaccines/mumps/en/\n\nwww.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/\n\nwww.who.int/immunization/wer8207mumps_Feb07_position_paper.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/immunization/diseases/mumps/en/\n\nwww.idsp.nic.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=406&lid=3689\n\nwww.indianpediatrics.net/june2015/june-505-514.htm", "symtoms":"After an incubation period (the period between infection and the appearance of signs of a disease) of some two to four weeks mumps begins with non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, headache, malaise and low-grade fever.\u00a0\n\n\tWithin a day of appearance of non specific symptoms, unilateral or bilateral (one side or both side) swelling of the parotid glands (in cheek and jaw area) develops with pain and tenderness.\n\n\tSwelling is first visible in front of the lower part of the ear then it extends downward and forward.

Centre for disease control and prevention, Atlanta (CDC) recommends two doses of MMR vaccine for children, starting with the first dose at 12 -15 months of age, and the second dose at four to six years of age.\n\n\tIAP recommends MMR at 9 months of age (measles containing vaccine ideally should not be administered before completing 270 days or 9 months of age), second dose at 15-18 months and third dose at 4-6 years of age.*\n\n\tRoutine mumps vaccination is recommended by WHO in countries with a well established, effective childhood vaccination programme and the capacity to maintain high levels of vaccination coverage with routine measles and rubella vaccination (coverage >80%) and where the reduction of mumps incidence is a public health priority.\n\n\t(Insufficient childhood vaccination coverage can result in an epidemiological shift in the incidence of mumps to older age groups, potentially leading to more serious disease burden than occurred before immunization was introduced).\n\nContraindications to mumps vaccine-\n\n\n\t\tMumps vaccine (live attenuated vaccine) should not be administered to individuals with advanced immune deficiency.\n\n\t\tMumps vaccination is contraindicated during pregnancy.\n\n\t\tAllergy to vaccine components, such as neomycin and gelatin, is a contraindication to administration of the vaccine.\n\n\nPrevention of transmission -\n\n\n\t\tPatients diagnosed with mumps should stay away with others for at least 5 days from the onset of symptoms.\n\n\t\tEncourage the patient for good hand washing practices.\n\n\t\tEncourage the patient to cover mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing with tissue, (put used tissue in the trash can) and if tissue is not available cover with upper sleeve or elbow, not the hands.\n\n\t\tDrinks and eating utensils of patient should not be shared by others.\n\n\t\tFrequently touched surfaces, such as toys, doorknobs, tables, counters should be kept clean.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/immunization/wer8207mumps_Feb07_position_paper.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/ith/diseases/mumps/en/\n\nwww.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks/outbreak-patient-qa.html\n\n\t* www.iapindia.org/iap-immunization.php", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Milk stasis is usually the primary cause, which may or may not be accompanied by or progress to infection.\n\n\tMilk stasis occurs when baby is not sucking properly, and milk is collected within the breast tissue of lactating woman, that may lead to non-infectious inflammation (or non-infectious mastitis). As the stagnant milk provides a suitable environment for the bacteria to grow (without effective removal of milk) non-infectious mastitis may progress to infectious mastitis, and further to formation of an abscess.\n\n\tVarious reasons for milk stasis may be:\n\n\n\t\tPoor attachment of the infant at the breast;\n\n\t\tineffective suckling;\n\n\t\trestriction of the frequency or duration of feeds;\n\n\t\ta blocked milk duct;\n\n\t\tan overabundant milk supply;\n\n\t\tlactating for twins or higher multiples.\n\n\t\tCracked nipple: Fissured or painful nipples may lead to avoidance of feeding on the affected breast and thus predispose to milk stasis. The commonest cause of trauma is poor attachment at the breast. Bacteria from women\u2019s skin or baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the skin of nipple or through a milk duct opening.\n\n\t\tA short frenulum (tongue-tie) in the infant has been observed clinically to interfere with attachment at the breast, and may cause cracked nipple.\n\n\t\tUse of a pacifier or a bottle and teat may be associated with poor attachment at the breast, sore nipples, and reduction in breastfeeding frequency and duration. Pacifiers may thus interfere with milk removal and predispose to milk stasis.\n\n\t\tTight clothing, and prone sleeping position are other mechanical factors that have been observed in connection with mastitis.\n\n\t\tMastitis may occur in the breast opposite to the preferred side for lactation.\n\n\n\tThe commonest organisms found in mastitis and breast abscess are coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus but less commonly, Streptococcus or\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Escherichia coli\u00a0may be found.\n\nReferences- \n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/66230/WHO_\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4048576/", "diagnosis":"Most cases of mastitis are diagnosed clinically.

On clinical examination of the breast he/she will focus on looking for signs of inflammation (erythema, localised tenderness, heat, engorgement and swelling) and nipple damage.\n\n\tBreast abscess is characterized by symptoms similar to mastitis, with the additional sign of a discrete tender lump, which may be tense or fluctuant. The mass may have overlying skin necrosis suggesting that the abscess is \u2018pointing\u2019 (abscess is sitting close to the surface of the skin).\n\nExamination of the infant and attachment to the breast: The infant should be examined for anatomical conditions such as cleft palate or tongue-tie which may interfere with attachment.\n\nInvestigation- Mastitis is a clinical diagnosis and investigations are not indicated in the initial assessment. If symptoms don\u2019t improve few days after proper management following investigations may be advised.\n\n\nUltrasound: Breast infection that does not improve with a course of appropriate antibiotics should be investigated with breast ultrasound.\n\nMammography: It is not a first line investigation in lactating women but is indicated if clinical, sonographic or biopsy features are suspicious for malignancy.\n\nBacteriological examination: Breastmilk for culture may be obtained by collecting a hand-expressed midstream clean-catch sample into a sterile container (i.e., a small quantity of the initially expressed milk is discarded to avoid contamination of the sample with skin flora, and subsequent milk is expressed into the sterile container, taking care not to touch the inside of the container).

Continued breastfeeding should be encouraged in the presence of mastitis and generally it does not pose a risk to the infant. She needs reassurance about the value of breastfeeding that it is safe to continue breastfeeding and milk from the affected breast will not harm her infant.\n\nHot and cold packs to breast: As milk stasis is often the initiating factor in mastitis, mother can apply heat (warm compresses or a warm shower)) to the breast prior to feedings.\n\nEffective milk removal: This is the most essential part of management of mastitis. Antibiotics and symptomatic treatment may make a woman feel better temporarily, but unless milk removal is improved, the condition may become worse or relapse despite the antibiotics.\n\n\tMother should be encouraged to breastfeed more frequently, as often and as long as the infant is willing, without restrictions starting on the affected breast. If necessary express breast-milk by hand or with a pump, until breastfeeding can be resumed.\n\n\tInfant should be well attached to the breast during breastfeeding and if there is any problem with attachment, mother should be helped by health care provider/ caregiver. If attachment is painful, a breast pump can be used to drain the breast until the pain decreases enough to allow the baby to feed from the breast.\n\n\tMassaging the breast during the feed with an edible oil or nontoxic lubricant on the fingers may also be helpful to facilitate milk removal. Massage, by the mother or a helper, should be directed from the blocked area moving toward the nipple.\n\nAntibiotic therapy: Health care provider may advise for antibiotic therapy in following situations:\n\n\n\t\tcell and bacterial colony counts and culture of breast milk are available and indicate infection,\n\n\t\tsymptoms are severe from the beginning, or\n\n\t\ta nipple fissure is visible, or\n\n\t\tsymptoms do not improve after 12-24 hours of improved milk removal.\n\n\n\tThe chosen antibiotic must be given for an adequate length of time.

Rinsing, brushing and flossing should be done immediately after eating.\n\n\tIn case of crowding, extraction of one or more teeth may be required to create space and align the teeth. Space maintainers are required to maintain space for permanent tooth in place of prematurely lost tooth, until the permanent tooth is not erupted. Severe malocclusions or complicated cases may also require surgical intervention. Retainers are given to the patient to stabilize the teeth in the desired new position, after completion of the treatment.

During the second day the baby may be remarkably stable on adequate support and resolution is noted during the third day, with a prompt diuresis.\n\n\tDespite huge advances in health care, NRDS remains the most common single cause of death in the first month of life in the developed world.\n\nReferences:\u00a0www.nhs.uk\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\nwww.youtube.com", "symtoms":"Along with tachypnea and tachycardia.\n\tThere include:\n\n\n\t\tBluish color of the skin and mucus membranes (cyanosis)\n\n\t\tApnea\n\n\t\tDecreased urine output\n\n\t\tGrunting\n\n\t\tNasal flaring\n\n\t\tRapid breathing\n\n\t\tShallow breathing\n\n\t\tUnusual breathing movement like drawing back of the chest muscles with breathing\n\n\nReference:\u00a0www.nhs.uk", "causes":"It is caused by developmental deficiency of surfactant (slippery and protective substance) production and structural immaturity in the lungs.

 {"id":195, "name":"Pseudostrabismus", "intro":"Neonatal conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia neonatorum) is defined as a conjunctival inflammation that occurs during first month of life after birth. Various causes have been implicated such as bacterial, viral including chemical conjunctivitis. Complications may be mild such as hyperaemia with scant conjunctival discharge to permanent scarring leading to even blindness.\n\n\tNeonatal conjunctivitis may be septic or aseptic:\n\nSeptic neonatal conjunctivitis:\n\n\tViral and bacterial infections are the leading causes of septic neonatal conjunctivitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes D-K) is the most common infective cause of neonatal conjunctivitis. Infective agents causing neonatal conjunctivitis may be transmitted to infant during delivery through birth canal. Simple bacterial conjunctivitis may be caused by organisms like Staphylococcus aureus. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 may cause blepharoconjunctivitis and may involve cornea leading to keratitis.\n\nAseptic conjunctivitis:\n\n\tSilver nitrate solution (1 %) is used for prophylaxis (prevention) of infectious conjunctivitis (Cred\u00e9\u2019s method). Aseptic neonatal conjunctivitis is commonly caused by the use of silver nitrate solution resulting in chemical conjunctivitis. Less commonly, Neonatal conjunctivitis may also be caused by antibiotics as well, which are used for prevention of infection. Chemical conjunctivitis is less common owing to the use of antibiotic such as erythromycin eye ointment in place of silver nitrate solution for the prophylaxis of infective conjunctivitis.\n\n\tHealthcare providers and parents should wash hands frequently to prevent transmission of infection. Sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and herpes simplex should be treated before the birth of infant through vaginal route.\n\n\tThe development of neonatal conjunctivitis in infant is influenced by the structure of conjunctival tissue. Inflammation may cause dilatation of blood vessels, discharge from eyes or chemosis (swelling) of conjunctiva. These changes tend to be more severe due to poor immunity, lack of immunoglobulin A (IgA), lack of tears at birth, decreased lysozyme activity and absence of lymphoid tissue in the conjunctiva.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1192190-overview \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Neonatal_Conjunctivitis\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4170304/\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/newborns.html\n\n\tBasak Samar K, Atlas of Clinical Ophthalmology, 2nd ed.

 {"id":196, "name":"Puerperal sepsis", "intro":"Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), Neurotrophic keratitis or Trigeminal neuropathic keratopathy is a rare degenerative corneal disease. It is characterised by lack of or decreased corneal sensation, corneal epithelial breakdown and impaired healing, resulting into increased susceptibility of the corneal surface to injury and compromised healing. In severe cases this can lead to stromal melting, corneal ulceration and even perforation.\n\nMagendie (1824), first described this disease. Neurotrophic keratopathy was initially described as \u201cneuroparalytic keratitis\u201d and experimentally demonstrated by Magendie, who hypothesized the presence of trophic nerve fibers in the trigeminal nerve regulating tissue metabolism.\n\n\tA decrease or absence of corneal sensation is the hallmark of neurotrophic keratopathy (Groos Jr EB, 1997).\n\n\tCorneal sensitivity is controlled by trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve). Corneal nerves also provide trophic (nutritive) support and play a key role in maintaining anatomical integrity and function of the cornea, particularly of epithelium (M\u03cbller LJ et.al. 2003).\n\n\tThe cornea is supplied by the long ciliary nerve, derived via the nasociliary nerve from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Any localised ocular or systemic condition which affects the nerve function along this course of the nerve (from trigeminal nucleus to the corneal nerve endings) can create corneal anaesthesia, resulting into neurotrophic keratopathy.\n\n\tThe cornea is one of the most richly innervated parts of the body. Corneal innervation not only provides sensations but is important in the maintenance of structure and function of the cornea. Normal innervation helps to regulate epithelial integrity, proliferation and wound healing of cornea.\n\n\tThe management of neurotrophic keratopathy is one of the most difficult and challenging task. Aim of therapy in neurotrophic keratopathy is prevention of disease progression, preservation of globe integrity and promotion of ocular surface repair. Prompt and aggressive treatment is important to prevent serious complications like infection, corneal ulceration, and perforation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1194889-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/NEUROTROPHIC_KERATITIS\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964170\u00a0\u00a0\n\nhttp://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v17/n8/full/6700616a.html\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/235971094_Nishida_T_Yanai_R_Advances_in_treatment_for_neurotrophic_keratopathy\n\nhttp://www.ophthalmologymanagement.com/articleviewer.aspx?articleID=107482\n\nhttps://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/354380\n\nhttp://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/805876\n\nBenitez-del-Castillo, Lemp Michael A.

The most common are herpes infections of the cornea, surgery for trigeminal neuralgia, and surgery for acoustic neuroma.\n\n\tVarious causes and associations of corneal anaesthesia are:\n\nFifth cranial nerve palsy:\n\n\n\t\tIntracranial: Aneurysms, neoplasms, stroke.\n\n\t\tIatrogenic: Surgery for acoustic neuroma or trigeminal neuralgia.\n\n\t\tGenetic: Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome, M\u00f6bius syndrome, familial corneal hypoaesthesia, or congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.\n\n\t\tFacial trauma.\n\n\nOcular:\n\n\n\t\tViral infections: Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster.\n\n\t\tToxicity: Chemical injury, toxic keratopathy due to drugs, chronic topical anaesthesia abuse.\n\n\t\tIatrogenic: Refractive laser surgery e.g. laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), trauma to ciliary nerves via laser or surgery, corneal incisions.\n\n\t\tContact lens wear.\n\n\t\tChronic ocular surface injury.\n\n\t\tOcular inflammation.\n\n\t\tDark colour of eyes.\n\n\t\tIncreasing age.\n\n\t\tAdie syndrome.\n\n\t\tThermal injury.\n\n\t\tOrbital neoplasia.\n\n\t\tCorneal dystrophies: Lattice, Granular.\n\n\nSystemic:\n\n\n\t\tDiabetes mellitus.\n\n\t\tVitamin A deficiency.\n\n\t\tLeprosy.\n\n\t\tMultiple sclerosis.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Pathogenesis:\n\n\tCorneal nerves are derived from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, and to a lesser degree from the maxillary nerve. The limbus and peripheral cornea also receive autonomic sympathetic innervations from the superior cervical ganglion. Disruption of sensory and sympathetic pathways is thought to lead to decreased cell division.\n\n\tNerves enter middle third of corneal stroma and run forward anteriorly in a radial fashion towards the center, where they lose their myelin sheath approximately 1mm from the corneal limbus. Stromal nerves form the sub-epithelial nerve plexus between Bowman\u2019s layer and the anterior stroma. They perforate Bowman\u2019s layer and form the sub-basal epithelial nerve plexus, providing innervations to the basal epithelial cell layer and terminate within the superficial epithelial layers. Thin branches of sub-epithelial plexus ascend and penetrate Bowman\u2019s layer, bending almost at a right angle to form the sub-basal nerve plexus at the basal epithelial cell layer.\n\n\tThe density of the sub-basal nerve plexus is reduced in NK and several predisposing disease states, including diabetes mellitus and viral keratitis. Reduced density of sub-basal nerves alters the concentration of several neuromediators and growth factors on the ocular surface. These neuromediators maintain a healthy ocular epithelial surface, in addition to altering rate of tear production. These include substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gelatine, methionine-enkephalin and acetylcholamine. Tear gland also helps in maintaining a healthy ocular surface epithelium by providing growth factors and other nutrients.\n\n\tDeficiency in neuromediator reduces mitosis rates in epithelial cells, leading to epithelial thinning and surface breakdown. Limbal stem cells fail to replace central epithelium, resulting in a persistent epithelial defect. There is also a reduction in microvilli on the epithelial surface, causing poor adherence of tears to the cornea. Reduction of goblet cell density within conjunctival epithelium also alters tear composition.\n\n\tNerve growth factors (NGF) are mediators known to be essential for development and maintenance of both sympathetic and sensory nerves. NGF also produces acetylcholine and substance P. The cornea and conjunctiva have specific nerve fiber receptors that maintain normal corneal nerve density and help in preservation of the epithelium.\n\n\tNormally a bidirectional interaction occurs between epithelial cells and nerve endings. Reduced corneal sensations render the corneal surface vulnerable to occult injury and decreased reflex tearing. It also appears to decrease healing rates of epithelial injury resulting in non healing epithelial defects.\n\n\tConsequently, corneal sensory nerve damage impairs the neuromediator- epithelium interactions, which leads to impairment of epithelial maintenance and physiological renewal, and the development of recurrent or persistent epithelial defects.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of neurotrophic keratopathy is based on the clinical history, findings and evaluation of corneal sensitivity. Testing of corneal nerve sensitivity and imaging of corneal nerves aid in the management of NK patients who cannot have corneal transplantation.\n\nClinical history:\n\n\tClinical history should include causes that can cause local injury to corneal sensory nerves (chronic topical drug or anaesthetic abuse, previous ocular trauma or surgery, chemical injury or use of contact lenses), therapies that can cause impairment of trigeminal innervations (antihistamine, antipsychotic, and neuroleptic drugs), systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and congenital diseases. Brain neoplasms and vascular accidents may damage the fifth cranial nerve or its nucleus.\n\nClinical presentation:\n\n\tImpairment of corneal sensation due to damage of trigeminal nerve leads to NK, which is characterised by ocular surface disorders such as:\n\n\n\t\tSuperficial punctate keratopathy.\n\n\t\tDryness of cornea.\n\n\t\tCloudy corneal epithelium.\n\n\t\tCorneal oedema.\n\n\t\tRecurrent and/or persistent epithelial defects of cornea.\n\n\t\tStromal melting.\n\n\t\tCorneal ulcers.\n\n\t\tCorneal perforation.\n\n\t\tDecreased blink rate.\n\n\t\tTear film instability with decreased tear film break up time (BUT).\n\n\n\tBased on the severity of corneal damage, Mackie (1995) classified neurotrophic keratopathy into three stages:\n\nStage 1: It is characterised by-\n\n\n\t\tSuperficial punctate keratopathy.\n\n\t\tRose bengal staining of the inferior conjunctiva.\n\n\t\tIncreased viscosity of tear mucous.\n\n\t\tDecrease in tear film break up time (BUT).\n\n\t\tEpithelial hyperplasia and irregularity.\n\n\t\tSuperficial neovascularisation of cornea.\n\n\t\tStromal scarring.\n\n\t\tScattered small facets of dry epithelium (Gaule spots).\n\n\t\tDellen (saucer-shaped thinning in peripheral cornea) formation.\n\n\nStage 2: It is characterised by-\n\n\n\t\tEpithelial defects, usually in the superior half of cornea with smooth and rolled edges.\n\n\t\tSurrounding rim of loose, poorly adherent opaque and oedematous epithelium around the epithelial defect.\n\n\t\tStromal oedema.\n\n\t\tDescemet membrane folds.\n\n\t\tInflammatory reaction in anterior chamber.\n\n\nStage 3: It is characterised by-\n\n\n\t\tCorneal ulcer.\n\n\t\tStromal melting.\n\n\t\tPerforation of cornea.\n\n\nClinical findings:\n\nCranial nerve examination:\n\n\tExamination of cranial nerves two to eight, including assessment of other divisions of the trigeminal (fifth cranial) nerve, may help in localising the site of underlying pathology causing corneal anaesthesia. Paresis of the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves may indicate an aneurysm or cavernous sinus involvement that also affects the trigeminal nerve. Dysfunction of the seventh and eighth cranial nerve may indicate damage from acoustic neuroma or its surgical removal. Suspicion of cranial nerve diseases warrant blood tests for diabetes mellitus, hypervitaminosis A and imaging of brain and/ or orbit.\n\nOrbital and adnexal examination:\n\n\tOrbital and adnexal examination assesses the protection offered to the ocular surface by the eyelids.\n\n\nOver exposure of cornea: Over exposure of cornea may lead to dry ocular surface that may accelerate breakdown of the corneal epithelium.\n\nThyroid eye disease: Previous thyroid eye disease may produce lid retraction and proptosis.\n\nBlepharitis: Blepharitis may cause inflammation of ocular surface.\n\nTrigeminal nerve: Previous surgery or trauma to trigeminal nerve.\n\nSeventh cranial nerve palsy: Seventh cranial nerve palsy may produce lagophthalmos and corneal exposure.\n\nBlink rate: Blink rate reduction may result in failure to distribute tears evenly over the ocular surface. This may lead to secondary dryness and exposure of cornea.\n\n\nTear film evaluation:\n\n\tTear film may be quantitatively and qualitatively affected by the reduction of corneal sensitivity.\n\n\nSchirmer\u2019s test: Schirmer\u2019s test evaluates tear production.\n\nTear film break up time (BUT): Tear film break up time (BUT) evaluates tear film stability.\n\n\nOcular examination:\n\n\nConjunctiva: Conjunctiva may show Bitot spots, which are associated with hypovitaminosis A.\n\nAnterior chamber: Anterior chamber activity may lead to corneal anaesthesia due to uveitis associated with chronic inflammatory disease.\n\nDilated ocular fundus examination: Dilated ocular fundus examination may reveal diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve pallor or oedema due to raised intracranial pressure produced by an intracranial tumour.\n\nCornea: Corneal examination under slit lamp (biomicroscopy) should be conducted for assessment. Vital stains such as fluorescein sodium, rose bengal or lissamine green may be used to visualise ocular surface. Corneal examination may reveal-\n\n\n\t- Stromal scars from previous keratitis resulting in ocular anaesthesia.\n\n\t- Evidence of previous LASIK.\n\n\t- Corneal epithelial defects.\n\n\t- Any asymptomatic corneal dystrophy.\n\n\t- Secondary bacterial infection.\n\nCorneal sensitivity evaluation:\n\n\tCorneal sensitivity evaluation is vital test to confirm the diagnosis of NK. Assessment of corneal sensitivity may be useful to assess the severity of corneal nerve impairment. A difference in corneal sensitivity in different quadrants of the cornea may indicate a local cause for anaesthesia, such as viral keratitis. It can be measured:\n\nQualitatively: By touching the central and peripheral part of cornea with a wisp of sterile cotton swab.\n\nQuantitatively: By a corneal aesthesiometer.\n\n\nCochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer: Cochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer quantifies corneal sensitivity by the length of a nylon filament required to initiate a blink reflex or a patient response.\n\nNon-contact aesthesiometer: New non-contact aesthesiometer allow the evaluation of chemical, mechanical and thermal sensitivity of the ocular surface. Belmonte non-contact aesthesiometer stimulates central cornea with a series of pulses of warmed air at multiple pressures. The lowest airflow that is able to elicit a response is identified as the mechanical threshold. The chemical detection threshold is assessed by stimulating the central cornea with a mixture of air and various concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the flow restricted to below mechanical detection threshold. Thermal sensitivity threshold is assessed by changes in temperature of airflow.\n\n\nIn vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM):\n\n\tIn vivo corneal confocal microscopy is a rapid and non-invasive imaging method, which provides understanding of corneal nerve morphology in health and in ocular and systemic diseases.\n\n\tICVM studies showed a significant decrease in number of sub-basal nerve fibers, and their density significantly correlates with reduced corneal sensation.\n\nHistological findings:\n\n\tHistological findings in neurotrophic keratopathy may show:\n\n\n\t\tDecrease in epithelial thickness with loss of surface desquamating layer.\n\n\t\tReduction of surface cell microvilli.\n\n\t\tIntracellular swelling of remaining surface epithelial cells.\n\n\t\tAreas of abnormal basal lamina.\n\n\t\tDecreased density of conjunctival goblet cells.\n\n\t\tIncreased length of surface microvilli.\n\n\nImpression cytology:\n\n\tImpression cytology may be necessary to rule out limbal deficiency of stem cells. Corneal epithelium is positive for cytokeratin 3 and negative for cytokeratin 19, while conjunctival epithelium is negative for cytokeratin 3 and positive for cytokeratin 19. If impression cytology from limbal area shows significant cytokeratin 19 (indicate conjunctival epithelium) and little cytokeratin 3 (indicate corneal epithelium), then the impression cytology would indicate limbal stem cell deficiency.\n\nNeurotrophic keratopathy should be differentiated from other ocular conditions with similar manifestations, such as:\n\n\tNeurotrophic keratopathy may have a similar clinical appearance to other ocular surface disorders at each clinical stage. History is often helpful in diagnosis towards NK and the presence of an anaesthetic cornea on clinical assessment is a critical sign.\n\nStage 1 NK: Features such as superficial punctate keratopathy and tear film abnormalities may be observed in diseases like:\n\n\n\t\tDry eye disease.\n\n\t\tExposure keratopathy.\n\n\t\tTopical drug toxicity.\n\n\t\tContact lens related disorders.\n\n\t\tMild chemical injury.\n\n\t\tBlepharitis.\n\n\t\tCorneal limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD).\n\n\n\tClinical history, clinical features and laboratory tests help in identifying the correct diagnosis, since all of these conditions may be associated with impairment of corneal sensation.\n\nLater stages of NK: Presence of corneal ulcers warrants exclusion of other causes, including immune and infectious, which are always present with ocular inflammation and stromal infiltration. Aetiologies to be excluded are:\n\n\n\t\tInfective corneal ulcer: A microbiological examination is performed to exclude viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.\n\n\t\tInflammatory corneal ulcer: Immune analysis for the presence of systemic autoimmune disease may be considered for an inflammatory ulcer.\n\n\t\tToxic-related corneal ulcer: History of topical therapy is necessary for a toxic-related corneal ulcer. Any local treatment should be discontinued to exclude drugs as the cause of toxic-related corneal ulcer.\n\n\t\tTraumatic epithelial defect: A history of trauma, even a mild injury, would be suggestive of a traumatic epithelial defect.\n\n\t\tRecurrent corneal erosion: Patients with recurrent corneal erosion may also give history of trauma.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tNeurotrophic keratopathy is one of the most difficult and challenging ocular diseases that lacks specific treatment, since no medication can improve corneal sensitivity.\n\n\tTill date, the treatment of NK is still conservative and any surgical procedure aimed at restoring corneal transparency should be discouraged because of the high risk of developing corneal epithelial defect, melting, ulcers, and perforation after surgery.\n\n\tThe primary aim of treatment is to protect the corneal surface and to promote epithelial re-growth. Treatment must begin early to prevent the progression of corneal damage and promote epithelial healing. Specific measures taken are based on the clinical stage of the disease at the time of presentation and severity of anaesthesia.\n\nStage 1 disease: Therapy in stage 1 disease aim at improving epithelial quality and transparency to avoid epithelial breakdown. A review of concurrent topical and systemic medications should be undertaken to minimise the use of therapies that might predispose to NK. Ideally, stage 1 disease requires discontinuation of all topical preparations. Other ocular surface associated diseases such as dry eye disease, exposure keratopathy and limbal stem cell deficiency disease, may require specific treatment.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nTopical artificial tears: To protect corneal epithelium and to minimise ocular surface irritation from long-term use, preservative-free topical preparations are considered for lubrication. Other topical preparations, if used for pre-existing ocular co-morbidity, may also be obtained preservative-free.\n\nEyelid hygiene: Eyelid hygiene and treatment of blepharitis improves meibomian gland function and reduces the risk of secondary infection.\n\nOral doxycycline: Oral doxycycline may be used to treat blepharitis and reduce tear concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs have been implicated as a contributing factor of the surface epithelium failing to heal in recurrent corneal erosion syndrome.\n\nBandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens was previously used as a temporary measure to protect the corneal surface. Bandage contact lens may introduce infection and be a risk factor for secondary infective keratitis.\n\nPunctal plugs: Punctal plugs may be considered to block punctum, in order to increase tears on the ocular surface.\n\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\nSurgical correction: Any exposure of the corneal surface, secondary to either an eyelid defect or lid malposition, should be corrected by surgical means.\n\nLimbal stem cell transplantation: Limbal stem cell transplantation may be considered in patients of NK with associated co-morbid condition of LSCD to improve the prognosis.\n\n\nStage 2 disease: \u00a0Epithelial defects should be treated to prevent the development of corneal ulcers, promote healing, and prevent the recurrence of corneal breakdown. All topical treatment for other ocular conditions should be discontinued, as there is significant risk of stromal lysis and perforation of ocular globe. While the mainstay of topical therapy is lubrication, there are several adjunctive topical therapies available to promote both corneal epithelial and nerve re-growth. Use of adjunctive therapy may be performed in combination with punctal plugging or a bandage contact lens.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nTopical artificial tears: Like stage 1 disease, preservative-free topical artificial tears may be used to improve corneal surface.\n\nTopical collagenase inhibitors: Topical collagenase inhibitors (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) may be considered to prevent stromal lysis and globe perforation.\n\nTopical autologous serum eye drops: Treatment with topical autologous serum eye drops has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and increase nerve density in the sub-basal plexus.\n\nUmbilical cord serum eye drops: Umbilical cord serum eye drops have also been shown to promote healing like topical autologous serum eye drops in a similar manner. Both preparations have been found to have significantly higher concentrations of neuromediators that play a role in corneal epithelial healing than human tears.\n\nNeuromediator preparations: Neuromediators and growth factors may represent a future therapeutic approach for the treatment and prevention of neurotrophic keratopathy. Preparations of individual neuromediators such as substance P in combination with insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factors, fibronectin and nerve growth factors, have been tried as a treatment of NK.\n\nInjection of botulinum toxin A: Injection of botulinum toxin A into the levator muscle induces temporary ptosis, and may be considered as an alternative to lateral tarsorrhaphy.\n\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\nLateral tarsorrhaphy: A lateral tarsorrhaphy may be performed to reduce the palpebral aperture, and thus the corneal exposure.\n\nPalpebral spring: Palpebral spring may be used for the eyelid levator to reduce the palpebral aperture thereby preventing corneal exposure.\n\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation may be utilised, more so in the management of refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers. It is effective in promoting corneal epithelial healing and in reducing ocular surface vascularisation and inflammation.\n\nCorneal neurotisation: In cases of unilateral NK, surgical replacement by corneal neurotisation of the dysfunctional nerve has been described. Branches of the contra-lateral supra-orbital and supratrochlear nerves may be attached at the limbus of the anaesthetic cornea.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0Associated ocular surface conditions also require treatment. Intensive preservative-free antimicrobial therapy is used for secondary bacterial \u00a0keratitis. Topical corticosteroids reduce inflammation, but it requires close observation, as there is significant risk of precipitating stromal lysis and \u00a0ocular globe perforation.\n\n\tNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated due to their potential of causing corneal melting as a side effect from their anaesthetic properties.\n\nStage 3 disease: In stage 3 disease, the cornea is at significant risk of perforation. This requires immediate intervention to stop stromal lysis and prevent the perforation. In such cases, preservation of the globe integrity rather than preservation of vision takes precedence. Like stage 1 and stage 2, avoid toxic effects of topical preparations and only preservative-free topical artificial tears and prophylactic topical antibiotics may be used.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nTopical artificial tears: Like stage 1 and stage 2 diseases, preservative-free topical artificial tears may be used to improve corneal surface.\n\nTopical collagenase inhibitors: In cases of corneal melting, topical collagenase inhibitors, such as N-acetylcysteine or medroxyprogesterone may be used.\n\nCorneal cyanoacrylate glue: Corneal cyanoacrylate glue application followed by insertion of a bandage contact lens may be used in the presence of small corneal perforations.\n\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\nConjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap may restore ocular surface integrity and provide metabolic and mechanical support for corneal healing. This is effective for the treatment of chronic corneal ulceration with or without corneal perforation.\n\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: In addition to other measures, multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation may be done to protect corneal surface.\n\nLateral Tarsorrhaphy: Lateral tarsorrhaphy is also effective in promoting corneal healing, but it provides a poor cosmetic outcome and visual function is sacrificed.\n\nLamellar and penetrating keratoplasty: Both lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty may be used for larger corneal perforations. As cases of NK are characterised by altered innervations and there is invariably limbal neovascularisation, perfoming keratoplasty is associated with a high failure rate and recurrence of an epithelial defect.\n\nBoston keratoprosthesis (Kpro): Boston keratoprosthesis (Kpro) may be an alternative to keratoplasty in the treatment of an anaesthetic cornea, but the risk of device extrusion from keratolysis and inflammation must be considered prior to Kpro surgery.\n\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tIt is important to stress to the patient to have frequent eye examination, since the disease often lacks signs and symptoms, and protection with preservative-free artificial tears to prevent epithelial breakdown is necessary.\n\n\tPrognosis of neurotrophic keratopathy depends upon:\n\n\n\t\tSpecific cause behind impairment of corneal sensitivity.\n\n\t\tThe duration of the condition.\n\n\t\tDegree of corneal anaesthesia or hypoesthesia.\n\n\t\tAssociation with other ocular surface disorders such as dry eye disease, exposure keratopathy and limbal stem cell deficiency.\n\n\n\tPrognosis of congenital NK is usually poor since no effective medical therapy is available. Most of the patients are likely to end up developing alterations in ocular surface or disease complications.\n\n\tUsually more severe the corneal sensory impairment, higher is the rapidity of disease progression towards stromal lysis/ melting, perforation and loss of sight due to anatomical loss of the eye or permanent loss of corneal transparency.\n\n\tPresence of associated ocular surface disease may affect the prognosis.\n\n\tEven in patients that do not have complete corneal anaesthesia or associated disease, sometimes even with timely appropriate therapy, neurotrophic keratopathy may may still progress to stage 3 (e.g. corneal ulcer). Neurotrophic corneal ulcer requires prompt treatment to stop stromal lysis and corneal perforation. Corneal ulcer may develop permanent diminution of vision from ensuing corneal scarring and astigmatism, even if there is no perforation.", "complications":"Anaesthetic cornea due to neurotrophic keratopathy may develop complications such as:\n\n\n\t\tBlurred vision due to epithelial irregularity, corneal neovascularisation or corneal scarring.\n\n\t\tSecondary infections leading to bacterial keratitis.\n\n\t\tCorneal perforation following stromal melting or corneal ulceration.", "Prevention":"Various agents used for prophylaxis (prevention) of neonatal conjunctivitis are:\n\nTopical prophylaxis:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Silver nitrate drops: Silver nitrate drops may be used and is the best agent in areas where the incidence of penicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) is significant.\n\n\tThe incidence of chemical conjunctivitis has declined as the use of silver nitrate is abandoned in many countries in favour of topical medication such as erythromycin.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Povidone-iodine solution.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tetracycline eye ointment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Erythromycin eye ointment.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tErythromycin ointment is considered the best regimen for prophylaxis against neonatal conjunctivitis because of its effectiveness against gonococcal, and also against non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal pathogens and owing to its low incidence of causing chemical conjunctivitis.\n\nSystemic prophylaxis:\n\n\tInfants with possible infectious exposure in-utero or during birth should receive appropriate prophylaxis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Systemic ceftriaxone: Systemic ceftriaxone is given to neonates born to mothers with untreated or suspected gonococcal infection.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

It is different from usual hobby some people have to collect certain items, in this disorder, they accumulate a large number of things filling up and cluttering active living areas of the home or workplace to the extent that the place cannot be used for the purpose it was meant for.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nTrichotillomania or Hair pulling disorder: A person having hair pulling disorder gets the urge to pull one\u2019s hair and experiences a lot of anxiety if he tries to resist it and a decrease in anxiety when he/she pulls the hair leading to gradual development of a visible loss of hair from the head. Sometimes the person additionally eats up the hair after pulling it. They are often brought to medical attention because of either unexplained loss of hair or stomach pain.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nExcoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder: This disorder is characterized by constant and recurrent picking at your skin resulting in skin lesions. The person fails to control the urge despite trying many times to reduce or stop it. This often results in medical complications like infections, scarring and physical disfigurement.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\n\n\t\tSaddock BJ, Saddock VA.

The outcome of treatment is best when medicines are used along with behavior therapy.\n\n\tIn general the therapeutic management comprises of a combination of\u00a0\n\n\t1.Medications: These include various anti anxiety and antidepressant drugs.\n\nSSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) e.g. Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Paroxetine etc.\n\n\n\t\tThese are currently considered the drug of choice for moderate to severe OCD and related disorders.\n\n\t\tThe dosage used are often higher than what works for Depression or anxiety in general.\n\n\t\tThey modulate the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain and show their efficacy in 2-3 weeks.\u00a0\n\n\t\tThey should only be taken under specialist guidance and any unwanted side effect or worsening of symptoms should be reported immediately.\n\n\t\tIn general SSRIs are relatively safer drugs as compared to the older antidepressants and the usual side effects are mild and usually self limiting e.g. headache, nausea, heart burn, nervousness etc, but you should immediately talk to your doctor if any unwanted side effect/change is noticed in body or mind.\u00a0\n\n\t\tPatient should never start or stop the medicines on their own as it may lead to worsening of the problem, discontinuation syndrome or even a paradoxical increase in anxiety or suicidal tendency.\n\n\t\tDepending on the disease severity the medicine may have to be taken for longer periods.\n\n\t\tSSRIs and other antidepressants and anti anxiety medicines are not habit forming drugs.\n\n\nSerotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIS). Desvenlafaxine, Venlafaxine, Duloxetin are also antidepressants may be useful in some OCD related disorders as add on therapy.\n\nTCAs (Tricyclic antidepressants) e.g. especially Clomipramine\n\n\tThis is an older antidepressant and once was used to be considered as the drug of choice for OCD and they act on other neurotransmitters as well apart from serotonin. Currently not used as first line drugs but still is quite useful in some patients or sometimes as a second drug at lower dosage to augment the treatment.\n\nBenzodiazepines(BZDs)\u00a0\n\n\tClonazepam, Lorazepam, Etizolam, Diazepam, Oxazepam, Chordiazepoxide.\n\n\n\t\tBZDs are also used to treat OCD and related disorders in the acute and short term. They are often prescribed along with SSRIs to provide short term relief from anxiety till the time SSRIs take their effect.\n\n\t\tThey are habit forming drugs and have abuse potential so they should be used in the short term under specialist supervision only.\n\n\nSerotonin dopamine agonists SDAs: e.g. Risperidone is useful in some patients as an add on therapy to augment the treatment or in patients who do not have insight into their OCD and related disorder or have co-morbid psychotic symptoms.\n\nElectro-convulsive therapy ECT: at times can be helpful in patients not responding to medications.\n\nRepetitive Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation rTMS: initial research seems promising in improving symptoms in some patients, more research is needed.\n\nPsychosurgery: Sometimes in extremely treatment unresponsive cases cingulotomy and capsulotomy is helpful, surgery may not cure the condition but it may help it become treatment responsive.\n\nDeep brain stimulation is another technique under research for treatment of OCD.\n\nOthers like Buspirone, Bupropion Hydrochloride, Mirtazapine, Valproate, Carbamazepine and Lithium are used as add on medicines in some patients.\n\nNote: The mediations should be taken under specialist guidance and any unwanted side effect or worsening of symptoms should be reported immediately.\n\n2.Psychotherapies\n\nA.Cognitive behavioural therapy: This form of psychotherapy is very effective in the treatment of OCD & related disorders and it involves the therapist using various techniques to help the patient understand and manage the factors that contribute to their disorder. Cognitive errors are corrected and behavioural techniques are used to reduce or stop undesired behaviour and relaxation techniques like deep breathing are used to control the bodily manifestations of anxiety.\n\nB.Supportive psychotherapy: In this psychotherapeutic approach a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques are used to foster a healthy mental state in the patient through a supportive therapeutic relationship with the patient.\n\nC.Family therapy: Family psychotherapy can help family members better understand their loved one's OCD and learn new ways of communication and interaction that do not reinforce the OCD and related disorder and associated dysfunctional behaviours and this in turn ensures treatment compliance and improves the outcome.\n\nD.Group therapy: In this the psychotherapy is done with a group of unrelated individuals all having OCD and related disorder and it\u2019s a very useful way of providing effective treatment and generating support.\n\n\tOthers adjunctive therapies like Music therapy, art therapy and various meditation styles and breathing relaxation techniques can also help some patients in addition to the first line treatment.\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\t\tMichael Kellner.

Both of these substances are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to cancer. The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.\n\nBetel nuts\n\n\tBetel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.\n\n\tThey have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.\n\n\tDue to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.\n\nSmokeless tobacco\n\n\tSmokeless tobacco is a general term used to refer to a range of products, such as:\n\n\n\t\tChewing tobacco\n\n\t\tSnuff \u2013 powdered tobacco designed to be snorted\n\n\t\tSnus \u2013 a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip, where it is gradually absorbed into your blood.\n\n\nCannabis\n\n\tSmoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer.

Men continue to produce this hormone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.\n\n\tDiseases of the hormone-producing glands There are increased chances of Osteoporosis by hormone-related diseases, including:\n\n\n\t\tHyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)\n\n\t\tDisorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing's syndrome\n\n\t\tReduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone)\n\n\t\tDisorders of the pituitary gland\n\n\t\tHyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands).\n\n\n\tOther things thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include:\n\n\n\t\tFamily history of osteoporosis\n\n\t\tA low body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less\n\n\t\tLong-term use of high-dose corticosteroid treatment (widely used for conditions such as arthritis and asthma), which can affect bone strength\n\n\t\tHeavy drinking and smoking\n\n\t\tRheumatoid arthritis\n\n\nReference:\u00a0www.nhs.uk", "diagnosis":"Osteoporosis is often diagnosed after the weakening of the bones has led to a fracture. Diagnosis can be made on suspicion when patient approaches a doctor for any other reason or x-ray is done otherwise and bones appear weak.\n\nConventional radiography\n\tConventional radiography is used either alone or in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass preosteoporosis). However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.\n\nDual-energy X-ray\n\tDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30\u201340-year-old) healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score.\n\nBiomarkers\n\tChemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Antibodies recognizes the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarkers for osteoporosis.\n\nReference: www.nhs.uk", "management":"Lifestyle\n\tTobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosis. Cessation of smoking and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended.\n\nNutrition\n\tVitamin D and calcium supplements together can result in preventing fractures. However, there is an increased risk of myocardial infarctions and kidney stones with excess of these supplements.\n\nMedications\n\tBisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures. Teriparatide (a recombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

 {"id":205, "name":"Rubella", "intro":"Ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where an immunologic response by donor cells against host tissues occurs due to incompatibility between the recipient and donor cells. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for haematologic, immunologic, metabolic and neoplastic diseases. HSCT is limited due to GVHD, which is a major cause of morbidity following allogeneic HSCT. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are the most important factors, triggering the immune response and leading to the onset of GVHD.\n\n\tTypes of transplantation depend upon the source of donor cells, though it is covered under the term bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Sources include autologous (from self), syngeneic (genetically identical), and allogeneic (other individual). The donor cells may be harvested not only from bone marrow but also from peripheral blood and blood from the placental cord.\n\n\tGVHD is an immune response by the donor cells (graft) against the recipient (host), resulting in an immunological attack against organ systems.\n\n\tTissues most commonly targeted by donor cells include:\n\n\n\t\tGastrointestinal system.\n\n\t\tLiver.\n\n\t\tSkin.\n\n\t\tMouth.\n\n\t\tLungs.\n\n\t\tEyes.\n\n\n\tTraditionally, based on the time of onset, GVHD has been characterised as:\n\n\n\t\tAcute.\n\n\t\tChronic.\n\n\n\tAcute GVHD occurs within the first hundred days after HSCT, while chronic GVHD occurs after that time. Ocular complications are most commonly associated with chronic GVHD.\n\n\tThis hundred days separation between acute and chronic held true in the myeloablative era (Myeloablative means killing of cells in bone marrow by chemotherapy or radiotherapy), but it was seen that non- myeloablative allogeneic HSCT and reduced intensity conditioning were associated with a two month delay in onset of acute GVHD, while acute and chronic GVHDs were found to present simultaneously in patients treated, for example, with lymphocyte infusions. Thus, with current consensus, it is primarily the clinical manifestations and not the time of onset of symptoms after transplant that determines the classification of GVHD as acute or chronic.\n\n\tThe prevalence of GVHD varies depending upon:\n\n\n\t\tAge.\n\n\t\tDonor cell compatibility.\n\n\t\tProphylaxis measures.\n\n\t\tHost environment.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://eyewiki.aao.org/Ocular_Graft_Versus_Host_Disease\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/429037-overview\n\nhttp://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/ocular-graftvshost-disease-downside-of-success-2\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770225\n\nhttp://www.bostonsight.org/PROSE-treatment/Conditions-PROSE-Treats/Graft-vs-Host-Disease-GVHD\n\nhttp://bjo.bmj.com/content/early/2016/06/06/bjophthalmol-2015-307666.abstract\n\nHolland Edward J, Mannis Mark J, Lee W Barry.

The primary cell responsible for this attack are the donor T-helper type 1 cells in acute GVHD and the donor T-helper type 2 cells in chronic GVHD.\n\n\tWhile the mechanism behind chronic GVHD has not been fully elucidated, there is a decreased tolerance to self- antigens and inflammatory reactions in multiple organ systems.\n\nConjunctivitis is commonly observed as a localised ocular reaction in GVHD.

Histopathology has revealed lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventually, total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD. Epithelial attenuation and goblet cell depletion have also been reported.\n\n\tIn GVHD, donor lymphocytes infiltrate the lacrimal gland, leading to widespread fibrosis and aqueous tear deficiency. Histopathology of the lacrimal gland in patients with chronic GVHD and DES reveals Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) - positive material accumulation in the acini and ductules, predominant T-cell infiltration in periductal areas, increased number and activation of stromal fibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix fibrosis. There is also prominent fibrosis of the glandular interstitium, similar to the chronic skin GVHD changes with generalised sclera-dermal lichenoid. Autopsy studies of the lacrimal gland in patients with GVHD have shown stasis of lacrimal gland secretions and epithelial cell debris within the lumina. Immunohistochemical studies show primarily CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) and CD8 T-cell infiltration in periductal area of lacrimal glands of patients with chronic GVHD.\n\nMeibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) can also lead to dry eye symptoms in patients with GVHD.

Ocular manifestations vary widely from mild findings, to severe ocular sequelae and can affect the eyelid, lacrimal gland, conjunctiva, tear film, cornea, lens, vitreous, retina and optic nerve.\n\nMost common presentation includes diseases of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland.\n\n\tAppropriate diagnosis and management of ocular GVHD is important in order to maintain visual acuity and good quality of life in cases treated with HSCT.\n\nDry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)\u00a0occurs in 70% of GVHD patients.\n\n\tBesides the symptoms of dryness, irritation, blurred vision, photophobia, redness and mucous discharge, patient may have any of the following signs:\n\n\n\t\tFeatures of dry eye.\n\n\t\tLacrimal gland dysfunction.\u00a0\n\n\t\tSpontaneous lacrimal punctal occlusion (SLPO).\u00a0\n\n\t\tCicatricial ectropion.\u00a0\n\n\t\tCicatricial entropion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\tTrichiasis.\u00a0\n\n\t\tMeibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)\n\n\t\tConjunctival inflammation and fibrosis.\u00a0\n\n\t\tCicatricial lagophthalmos. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\tSterile conjunctivitis.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\tConjunctival oedema or chemosis.\n\n\t\tPseudomembrane formation.\n\n\t\tPunctate keratopathy.\n\n\t\tCorneal epithelial erosions.\u00a0\n\n\t\tCorneal infections.\u00a0\n\n\t\tChronic filamentary keratitis.\n\n\t\tCorneal scarring.\n\n\t\tCalcareous corneal degeneration.\n\n\t\tCorneal ulceration.\n\n\t\tCorneal perforation.\n\n\t\tUveitis.\n\n\t\tSynechiae.\u00a0\n\n\t\tCataract.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\tRetinal vasculitis.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\tRetinal haemorrhage.\u00a0\n\n\t\tOptic neuropathy.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClassification:\n\nMultiple classification systems have been used to categorise ocular GVHD.\n\nIn 1989, Jabs et al. proposed a clinical staging system for conjunctival involvement in ocular GVHD.\n\nClinical Staging System for Conjunctivitis in Ocular GVHD (Jabs et al. 1989):\n\n\nStage I: Hyperaemia.\n\nStage II: Hyperaemia with chemosis and/or serosanguineous exudates.\n\nStage III: Pseudo-membranous/membranous conjunctivitis.\n\nStage IV: Pseudo-membranous/membranous conjunctivitis with corneal epithelial sloughing.\n\n\nIn 1998, Kiang et al. characterised the course of ocular GVHD into four stages.\n\nStages of Ocular GVHD (Kiang et al. 1998):\n\n\nStage 1 or Subclinical stage: Tearing, mild nonspecific discomfort and photophobia. Mild chemosis, possible rose bengal staining. It lasts from a few days up to 1 month before other systemic symptoms of GVHD occur or the patient progresses to a more severe form of ocular GVHD.\n\nStage 2 or Active stage: Muco-purulent conjunctivitis. Pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis, punctate keratitis or corneal abrasion. Patients usually have systemic manifestations of GVHD.\n\nStage 3 or Convalescent stage: Secondary sicca. Irregular eyelid margins with obstructed meibomian gland orifices, tarsal and forniceal scarring and punctate corneal epitheliopathy.\n\nStage 4 or Necrotising stage: Corneal melting and possible corneal perforation.\n\n\n\tAn alternative classification system was proposed by Robinson et al. in 2004. In this system, clinically relevant grading criteria for conjunctival GVHD is based on conjunctival pathology, observed in chronic GVHD patients.\n\nClinical Grading Criteria for Conjunctival GVHD (Robinson et al. 2004):\n\n\nGrade 1: Conjunctival hyperaemia occurring on the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva in at least one eyelid.\n\nGrade 2: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes occurring along the superior border of the upper eyelid, or the lower border of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid, with or without conjunctival epithelial sloughing, involving <25% of the total surface area in at least one eyelid.\n\nGrade 3: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes occurring along the superior border of the upper eyelid, or the lower border of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid, involving 25- 75% of the total surface area in at least one eyelid.\n\nGrade 4: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes involving >75% of the total surface area with or without a cicatricial entropion in at least one eyelid.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClinical tests: \n\n\nSchirmer test: Schirmer test assists in diagnosis of lacrimal function in chronic ocular GVHD. New onset KCS with Schirmer score of 6-10mm or a symptomatic patient with Schirmer score of \u00b1 5mm in presence of other organ involvement forms the criteria for diagnosis of chronic ocular GVHD.\n\nOcular surface disease index (OSDI): Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) is shown to be statistically higher in patients with chronic ocular GVHD than in pre-transplant or post-transplant patients without ocular GVHD (Agomo et al. 2008).\n\nVideokeratoscope: Videokeratoscope may be used in the evaluation of patients with higher aberrations in patients of chronic GVHD (Chang-Strepka 2009).\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology: \n\n\tHistopathology of the conjunctival biopsy may reveal lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventual total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDiagnostic criteria:\n\n\tThe diagnostic criteria for ocular GVHD were established by the National institutes of Health Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic GVHD in 2005. The Diagnosis and Staging Working Group has stated that a mean Schirmer value of 5mm at 5 minutes or new onset of keratoconjunctivitis sicca by slit lamp examination, with a mean Schirmer value of 6- 10mm, is sufficient for the diagnosis of Chronic GVHD, if accompanied by involvement of at least one other organ system.\n\n\tThe NIH Health Consensus Development Project defined findings of new-onset dry, gritty, or painful eyes, cicatricial conjunctivitis, KCS, and confluent areas of punctuate keratopathy, as well as periorbita hyper-pigmentation, difficulty in opening the eyes in the morning because of dried mucoid secretions, and blepharitis as \u2018distinctive signs\u2019 (seen in chronic GVHD but insufficient, alone, to establish a diagnosis of chronic GVHD). As per report, a diagnosis of chronic GVHD could be made in the presence of one diagnostic sign or the presence of a distinctive sign (confirmed by biopsy and laboratory testing) and/or distinctive signs in one other organ system. This formed the basis for the addition of two new categories to the existing classification of GVHD: persistent, recurrent, or late-onset acute GVHD (>3 months) and overlap syndrome (no temporal relation) in which features of acute and chronic GVHD appear together. \u00a0Chronic GVHD based only on ocular findings (presence of one distinctive sign) can be confirmed on the basis of biopsy evidence of KCS or Schirmer test and if accompanied by distinctive manifestations in at least one other organ. Routine screening biopsy serves little benefit for early detection of ocular GVHD. Lacrimal gland biopsy is invasive and risks decreasing the functional capacity of the gland.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\tDue to similar clinical features, ocular GVHD should be differentiated from:\n\n\n\t\tAutoimmune diseases.\n\n\t\tCollagen vascular diseases.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tA multidisciplinary approach that incorporates collaboration with other medical teams is essential for GVHD patients. This includes collaboration with the haematology and oncology services and stem cell transplantation services.\n\n\tThe management of ocular GVHD includes:\u00a0\n\n\tI. Primary prevention\n\n\tII. Secondary therapeutic approaches which includes medical, both local and systemic, and surgical therapies.\n\nI. Primary prevention:\n\n\tPrevention of disease plays an important role in decreasing the morbidity associated with ocular GVHD.\n\n\nEnvironmental modifications: Environmental modifications and decreased exposure to low-humidity settings may reduce DES symptoms. Cool mist humidifiers can be particularly helpful for environmental modifications at home, including bedside use while sleeping.\n\nUltraviolet light exposure: Minimising ultraviolet light exposure also helps.\n\nEye evaluation: Regular eye evaluation may monitor for the development of infection, cataract, and intraocular pressure elevation. Therefore, a thorough ocular exam is recommended prior to HSCT.\n\nTopical cyclosporine: Prophylactic use of topical cyclosporine (0.05%) might also reduce severity of disease.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nII. Secondary therapeutic approaches:\n\n1. Systemic medical therapy:\n\n\nImmunosuppression: Systemic immunosuppressive medications may be effective in preventing manifestations of GVHD, but this benefit must also be weighed against the associated risks of infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hypertension, and even death. Agents include tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, methotrexate, sirolimus, antithymocyte globulin, Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy and corticosteroids. These systemic therapies are often reserved for severe or refractory cases, due to long term adverse events with chronic use. First-line treatments are instead targeted towards specific organ systems with ocular immunosuppressive agents. \u00a0\n\n\n2. Local medical therapy:\n\n\tSuccessful treatment modalities include eye lubrication, reduction of tear evaporation, minimising ocular surface inflammation, and immunosuppression.\n\na. Lubrication and Reduction of Tear evaporation:\n\n\nPreservative-free artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears and ophthalmic lubricating ointments are effective approaches in providing lubrication and diluting inflammatory mediators in the tear film.\n\nPunctal occlusion: Punctal occlusion may effectively decrease tear drainage from the ocular surface, with either silicone plugs as temporary measure or permanent thermal cauterisation.\n\nMoisture chamber goggles: Moisture chamber goggles may also prove beneficial in reducing tear evaporation and increasing patient comfort.\n\nTreatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD): Dry eyes may be exacerbated by dysfunction of Meibomian and Zeis glands, both of which normally serve to produce the outer lipid layer of the tear film. The lipid layer is crucial in minimising evaporation of tears from the corneal surface. Treatment involves:\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Warm compresses.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lid Hygiene.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oral tetracyclines or azithromycin.\n\nb. Minimising ocular surface inflammation and immunosuppression:\n\n\nTopical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroid reduces ocular surface inflammation. The mechanism of action is through lymphocyte apoptosis (programmed cell death without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area) and blockage of cell-mediated inflammation. Topical steroids are often combined with prophylactic topical antibiotic and tapered to avoid potential side effects. Patient is monitored for corticosteroid-induced side effects. They are contraindicated in patients with infiltrates, epithelial defects or stromal thinning of the cornea.\n\nTopical cyclosporine A: Topical cyclosporine A is an anti-inflammatory drug, which produces local inhibition of T lymphocytes and cytokine production in the conjunctiva.\u00a0 Cyclosporine may minimise destruction of lacrimal gland tissue and reduce dry eye. There may be improvement in corneal sensitivity, tear evaporation rate, tear break-up time, vital staining scores, goblet cell density, conjunctival squamous metaplasia and inflammatory cell numbers after treatment with topical cyclosporine. This has been used primarily in patients of chronic GVHD and KCS with minimal improvement, despite treatment with lubrication and topical steroids.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nc. Autologous serum eye drops: Autologous serum eye drops (20-50%) have been used safely and effectively in the treatment of DES in patients with ocular GVHD. Unlike artificial tears, they contain albumin, epidermal growth factor, fibronectin, vitamin A, neurotrophic growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor, all of which may help in maintaining stable tear film. A potential concern with this treatment is the risk of contamination which may produce infection.\n\nd. Scleral contact lenses: Scleral contact lenses have also been used in patients with severe or refractory dry eye disease. These larger contact lenses create a tear-filled vault on the corneal surface without corneal contact. These include Jupiter lenses, as well as the custom-designed PROSE (Prosthestic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem) lenses.\n\ne. Mucolytic agents: Mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine (10%) may be used to treat severe filamentary keratitis.\n\nf. Newer treatment modalities: Newer agents include topical immunomodulator tranilast (rizaben), topical tacrolimus, and retinoic acid, although large scale studies are needed.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n3. Surgical therapy:\n\n\tSurgical therapy may be needed in most severe cases of GVHD where maximal medical therapy may fail in reducing symptoms and protecting the ocular surface.\n\n\nTarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy may be required to protect the ocular surface. Tarsorrhaphy may be performed with suture, glue adhesive, or botulinum toxin. Suture is the best technique as most patients with severe GVHD require a permanent tarsorrhaphy.\n\nAmniotic membrane grafting: Amniotic membrane grafting may be done to protect the corneal surface. Amniotic membrane may be placed with suture or fibrin glue in one or multiple layers, or in conjunction with a carrier, such as with bio-tissue ProKera or AmbioDisc.\n\nCyanoacrylate glue patching: Cyanoacrylate glue patching may be performed in small descemetoceles or corneal perforations.\n\nDeep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) may be done for large descemetocele.\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty (PK): Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) may also be performed for large descemetocele. In patients with large corneal perforations, penetrating keraoplasty must be performed on an emergency basis with strong consideration of placement of a concurrent tarsorrhaphy and/or amniotic membrane graft.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tOcular involvement, though rare in systemic acute GVHD, is considered a poor prognostic factor for mortality caused by systemic acute GVHD.

For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods, without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain. \n\n\tOnce it was thought as a problem of high income countries now the problem of overweight and obesity are increasing in low income and middle income countries especially in urban areas. Since 1980 obesity has doubled worldwide. In 2014 more than 1.9 billion adults (18 years and older) and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight. Nearly half of the children under five who were overweight or obese in 2014 lived in Asia.\n\n\tOverweight and obesity are emerging health problems in India. According to National family health survey India-3 (NFHS-3), thirteen percent of women (15-49 Years) and nine percent of men (15-49 Years) were overweight or obese in 2005-06. Overweight prevalence was higher in urban areas than rural areas and lower in people who are involved in agriculture or manual work.\n\n\tWorld Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A simple measure commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index (BMI).\u00a0 BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). WHO identifies overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (\u226523.0kg/m2) and obesity (\u226525.0kg/m2) are lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.\n\n\tOverweight and obesity kills more people than underweight and act as a predisposing factor for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart attack and stroke), diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).\n\n\tObesity during childhood also causes breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, and psychological effects.

It develops gradually over time when there is disturbance in energy balance. Energy balance means that \u201cenergy in\u201d through food intake and \u201cenergy out\u201d through physical activities. Consuming excess calories from high-fat foods, sugars and doing little or no daily physical activity over the long time will lead to weight gain. The reasons for the imbalance between calorie intake and energy out may vary from individual to individual.\n\n\nGenetics may play a role in conversion of food into energy and how body burns calories during exercise. Genes may affect the amount of fat storage and distribution of fat in body.\n\nFamily history- A person is more likely to develop obesity if one or both parents are obese. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families not just because of genetics but family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. Children\u2019s choices, diet and physical activity habits are influenced by their surrounding environment.\n\nUnhealthy diet- Diet rich in calories (fast foods), high calorie beverages, oversized portions, bad eating habits (eating between meals, preference to sweets, refined foods, and fats), diet lacking with fruits and vegetables; all these factors contribute to weight gain.\n\nSedentary life style- With a sedentary lifestyle such as sedentary occupation and inactive recreation (watching television) more calories are stored in the body every day than used through exercise. Thus sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain. If there is any associated medical problems such as arthritis can lead to decreased activity; that contributes to weight gain.\n\nHealth conditions- Some medical conditions may cause over weight and obesity because of hormonal disturbances such as hypothyroidism, Cushing\u2019s syndrome and poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn hypothyroidism there is lack of thyroid hormone that slows down the metabolism and causes weight gain.\n\n\t\t\t\tPCOS is a condition that affects women of child bearing age. It is often associated with obesity due to high levels of androgens.\n\n\t\t\t\tIn Cushing syndrome there is increased production of cortisol hormone from adrenal glands.\n\n\n\nMedicines-Certain medicines such as corticosteroids, antidepressants and medicines used for seizure control may cause weight gain.\n\nEmotional factors- For some people, eating habits are influenced by emotions such as sadness, stress, boredom or anger and they react by eating excessively.\n\nSmoking- Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. However, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain.\n\nAge- Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. Infants with excessive weight have increased chances of obesity in later life. As age increases, muscle mass tends to decrease and some hormonal changes also occur; these factors along with less active lifestyle increase the risk of obesity in later age.\n\nSex-\u00a0Men have more muscle mass and use more calories (even at rest) than women. Thus, women are more likely to gain weight as compare to men with the same calorie intake; however midlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but at menopause hormonal changes also play a role in weight gain.\n\nPregnancy- Woman gain weight during pregnancy and, some women find it difficult to lose weight after child birth. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.\n\nLack of sleep- Not having enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that may increase appetite and craving for foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.\n\nEnvironment- If environment doesn\u2019t support healthy lifestyle, it encourages obesity. Some reasons include-\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLack of neighborhood sidewalks, parks, and safe places for recreation prevents people to be physically active.\n\n\t\t\t\tPeople working with long work hours and time spent commuting don\u2019t have enough time to be physically active.\n\n\t\t\t\tLack of access to healthy foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, or, for some people these healthy foods are too costly.\n\n\t\t\t\tLack of awareness about healthy diet and healthy cooking practices.\n\n\t\t\t\tFood advertisements for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks promote people to buy them.\n\n\n\n\n\tThere are two different kinds of distribution of body fat that play a role in determining risk of obesity \u2013related health problems;\n\n\n\t\texcess body fat distributed around the waist (apple-shaped figure, intra-abdominal fat);\n\n\t\texcess body fat distributed on the hips and thighs (pear-shaped figure, fat under the skin)\n\n\nFat collected around the waist (apple-shaped figure) carries more risk for obesity related health problems.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/\n\nwww.medicinenet.com/obesity\n\nwww.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity\n\nwww.emedicinehealth.com/obesity", "diagnosis":"(a) Assessment of obesity\n\nHeight and weight are the most simple and commonly used measures. Overweight and obesity can be diagnosed by calculating body mass index (BMI) of an individual. BMI generally correlates with fat accumulation although it can sometimes misclassify total body fat content as seen in athletes who are muscular, have high BMI due to muscle weighing more than fat and will have BMI within the overweight range even though they are not fat. The adult BMI cut-offs are not considered appropriate for children as they are still growing.\n\n\tBMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). \u00a0BMI (Metric Formula) =Weight in Kilograms/Height in meters2 \u00a0\u00a0.\n\n\tWHO defines overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0kg/m2; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30.0kg/m2.

Avoid oversized portions. Use a smaller plate, bowl, and glass.\n\nFood weight: \u00a0Eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food; for example; replacing a full-fat food product that weighs two ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.\n\nVery-low-calorie diet (VLCD): gives less than 800 calories a day. Though these diets can lead to rapid weight loss, but\u00a0they aren't a safe method for everyone. VLCDs are only recommended when obesity-related complication would need rapid weight loss.\n\n(ii) Physical activity- This is an important part of weight reducing programme. Regular physical exercise is essential to increase energy expenditure. Few important suggestions are-\n\n\n\t\tConsult the physician before starting physical activity specially those who are having other medical problems along with obesity.\n\n\t\tStart physical activity slowly and increase intensity and duration gradually with time. Low to medium intensity is sufficient. It is not necessary to participate in strenuous activity.\n\n\t\tChoose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.\n\n\t\tStart activity with doing more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of elevators and doing house hold chores.\n\n\t\tThe next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace and increase the exercise time, or increase the intensity level of the activity gradually. (Brisk walk, dancing, gardening, and water aerobics are moderate-intensity physical activity).\n\n\n(iii) Behavioral changes-\u00a0Changing behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight such as:\n\n\n\t\tChange the habits promoting weight gain such as watching television for long hours.\n\n\t\t\u00a0Keep a record of your weight loss.\n\n\t\tAsk for help or encouragement from friends, family, and health care provider.\n\n\t\tReward the success for meeting weight-loss goals.\n\n\n(b)Prescription anti-obesity drugs can be useful adjuncts to diet and exercise for obese adults who have failed to achieve weight loss with diet and exercise. Drugs are only prescribed when BMI is 28 kg/m\u00a02 or more with other weight related conditions or BMI 30 kg/m\u00a02 or more.\n\n(c)Weight loss surgery-also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese (for BMI of 35 kg/m\u00a02 with co-morbidity or BMI over 40 kg/m\u00a02). Common weight-loss surgeries include:\n\n\n\t\tGastric bypass surgery\n\n\t\tLaparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)\n\n\t\tBiliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch\n\n\t\tGastric sleeve\n\n\n(d)Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology is used in adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss programme and who have a BMI of 35 - 45 kg/m\u00a02 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.\n\nReferences-\n\nemedicine.medscape.com/article/123702-treatment\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/\n\nwww.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics\n\nwww.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/patient\n\nwww.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/\n\nwww.nhs.uk/Conditions/Obesity/Pages/Treatment.aspx", "complications":"Obesity can increase the risk of developing many health conditions -\n\n\n\t\tType 2 Diabetes\n\n\t\tHypertension (High blood pressure)\n\n\t\tCoronary heart disease and stroke\n\n\t\tMetabolic syndrome (a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity)\n\n\t\tCancer- Colon cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, endometrial cancer\n\n\t\tGallstones (stones in gallbladder)\n\n\t\tGastro-oesophageal reflux disease(GORD)- (condition in which acids from stomach regurgitates in to oesophagus)\n\n\t\tAsthma\n\n\t\tOsteoarthritis- Pain and stiffness in joints\n\n\t\tLow back pain\n\n\t\tReduced fertility\n\n\t\tSleep apnoea (interrupted breathing during sleep)\n\n\t\tLiver disease\n\n\t\tKidney disease\n\n\t\tPregnancy complications such a gestational diabetes, Pre-eclampsia, foetal defects\n\n\t\tObesity reduces life expectancy by an average of\u00a03 to\u00a010 years according to its severity.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.wpro.who.int/nutrition", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":207, "name":"Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease", "intro":"Osteoarthrithis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in both developed and developing countries.\u00a0 It is a chronic, progressive musculoskeletal disorder characterized by gradual loss of cartilage in joints which results in bones rubbing together and creating stiffness, pain, and impaired movement. The disease most commonly affects the joints in the knees, hips, hands, feet, and spine. The disease is associated with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, genetic predisposition, bone density, occupational injury, trauma, and gender.\n\n\tOsteoarthritis can be classified into two groups primary and secondary. Primary osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease and is related to aging. The water content of the cartilages decreases on increasing age, thus making them more susceptible to degradation. While secondary arthritis usually affects the joints earlier in life due to specific causes \u00a0such as injury during a job requiring frequent kneeling or squatting for long duration, diabetes and obesity.\n\n\tOsteoarthritis primarily affects the elderly population. It is a major cause of disability in older adults worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women ageds over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis worldwide. 80% of those with osteoarthritis have limitations in movement, and 25% cannot perform their major daily activities of life.\n\n\tOsteoarthritis is the second most common rheumatologic problem and it is the most frequent joint disease with a prevalence of 22% to 39% in India. OA is more common in women than men. Nearly, 45% of women over the age of 65 years have symptoms while 70% of those over 65 years show radiological evidence of OA.\n\n\tThe prevalence of OA is increasing due to population ageing and an increase in related factors such as obesity, sedentary life style. The physical disability arising from pain and loss of functional capacity reduces quality of life and increases the risk of further morbidity. As highly effective medicinal management is not available emphasis should be given to preventive aspect of life style measures in the form of healthy diet and exercise.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/Ch6_12Osteo.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/BP6_12Osteo.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/chp/topics/rheumatic/en/\n\n\tPal CP, Singh P, Chaturvedi S, Pruthi KK, Vij A, Epidemiology of knee osteoarthritis in India and related factors.

The disease may eventually progress to the point where the patient even feels pain during rest. Some people report pain so intense that it wakes them up when they are sleeping.\n\n\tKnee or hip pain may lead to reduced physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle that may increase the weight gain and further obesity. Being overweight or obese can lead to the development of diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure.\n\n\tPeople with OA have greater chances of fall and fracture than those without OA due to presence of risk factors such as decreased function of joints, muscle weakness and impaired balance.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/BP6_12Osteo.pdf\n\nwww.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/osteoarthritis/symptoms.php", "causes":"Risk Factors for occurrence and progression of osteoarthritis-\n\n\ti) Age- Normal ageing processes cause increased OA progression.\u00a0 Incidence increases with age but stays at the same level around age 80.\n\n\tii) Trauma- Injury to collateral ligament, meniscal tears and joint fractures lead to increased risk for OA.\n\n\tiii) Occupation: OA is more common in those performing heavy physical work, occupational kneeling or repetitive use of joint during work.

Management plan should be regularly reviewed which is broadly divided into non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatments. Non-pharmacological treatments should be started first, followed by pharmacological treatment and then surgery if the first two are unsuccessful.\n\n\tAccording to various recommendations, non-pharmacological treatment of OA should include education, exercise, weight reduction and physical aids (such as canes, insoles and knee braces).\n\nEducation-\n\n\tIt is reported that patient education in disease management, weight reduction and exercise is quite effective in reducing joint pain. Effective educational techniques include individualized education, group education, social support, patient coping skills, and spouse assisted coping skills (coping skills : enhance patients\u2019 ability to control and decrease pain by increasing use of adaptive coping strategies such as distraction, relaxation, and changing activity patterns as pain is affected by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors).\n\nExercise-\n\n\tExercise is the most important intervention in the management of OA. Exercise builds muscle strength and endurance, improves joint flexibility and motion. Exercise is beneficial even to those patients who are at a healthy weight because increased muscle strength can reduce some of the complications of OA. With the doctor\u2019s advice low impact activities that will not increase the chance of exacerbating symptoms of OA should be encouraged.\n\n\n\t\tSimple activities like walking around the neighborhood or taking a fun, easy exercise class can reduce pain and help maintain (or attain) a healthy weight.\n\n\t\tStrengthening exercises build muscles around OA-affected joints.\n\n\t\tStretching: slow, gentle stretching of joints may improve flexibility, decreases stiffness and reduces pain. Exercises such as yoga and tai chi can be practiced to manage stiffness.\n\n\t\tRange-of-motion exercise helps maintain and improve joint flexibility and reduce stiffness.\n\n\t\tAerobic exercise helps to improve stamina and energy levels and also help to reduce excess weight.\u00a0\n\n\nWeight loss-\n\n\tOverweight and obese patients with osteoarthritis experience more pain and disability than patients who are not overweight. Excess weight adds additional stress to weight-bearing joints, such as the hips, knees, feet and back. Lifestyle behavioural weight management (BWM) interventions such as eating fewer calories and increasing physical activity should be encouraged to lose weight.\n\nPhysical aids-\n\n\tOther Non-pharmacological therapy includes a referral to a physical therapist; knee braces, orthotics, and appropriate footwear can reduce pain and improve function in people with poor alignment.\n\nHeat and cold-\n\n\tHeat or cold (or combination of the two) can be used in OA. Heat can be applied with warm towels, hot packs, or warm bath (it increases blood flow and reduces pain and stiffness). In some cases cold packs can relieve pain or numb the sore area by reducing inflammation.\n\nMassage-\n\n\tMassage with lightly stroke and /or knead the painful muscles may be a pain relief approach.\n\n\tApart from the traditional non-pharmacological approaches pulsed ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electro-acupuncture, and low level laser therapy are newer therapies.\n\nPharmacological therapy-\n\n\tThe primary strategy for pharmacological management of OA is to control pain and improve function and quality of life for the patient, while limiting drug toxicity as there is no cure for OA.\n\nParacetamol (Acetaminophen): Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a commonly prescribed oral analgesic to treat mild to moderate OA pain.\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs can be used for relieving pain in OA (However, treatment with NSAIDs is associated with gastrointestinal effects and potential toxicity, especially in the elderly persons). New classes of NSAIDS called Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX\u20192) inhibitors are also in use (one of the class, refecoxib was found to increase the risk of cardiovascular events and was withdrawn in 2004, celecoxib and eterocoxib are in use). Topical NSAIDs, in the form of cream, patches, gels, solutions, have been found to be effective in reducing pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions, including OA. The benefit of topical NSAIDs is that they eliminate the gastrointestinal side effects of oral treatment. However, they have been associated with certain local adverse effects and they may be less effective than oral NSAIDs.\n\nOpioids may be used for pain relief in patients who cannot use either NSAIDs or acetaminophen; however drug abuse is high with opioids.\n\nIntra-articular corticosteroids: Treatment with corticosteroids injected directly into the joint (intra-articular) has been shown to be effective, especially in OA of the knee.\n\nViscosupplementation: This involves a series of injections of either hyaluronan or hylan products (hyaluronan is a polysaccharide and is one of the main components of the extracellular matrix).\n\nSurgical Management-\n\nJoint replacement surgery: Patients who experience severe pain and show extensive narrowing of joint space and medicines are not effective; these patients are eligible for joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement surgery is removing a damaged joint and putting in an artificial one (A joint is where two or more bones come together, like the knee, hip, and shoulder).\n\nOsteotomy: Osteotomy is the cutting and reshaping of bones with the purpose of altering the area of the joint which bears weight.\n\nArthroscopic debridement and lavage are two processes that involve removing damaged cartilage, bone, and excess debris surrounding the joint.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/BP6_12Osteo.pdf\n\nwww.niams.nih.gov/health_info/joint_replacement/\n\nwww.niams.nih.gov/health_info/osteoarthritis/#10", "complications":"Complications of osteoarthritis includes-\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Complete breakdown of cartilage resulting in loose tissue material in the joint (chondrolysis).\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bleeding inside the joint\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Infection in the joint\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bone death (osteonecrosis)\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stress fractures (hairline crack in the bone)\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deterioration or rupture of the tendons and ligaments around the joint\n\n\t\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pinched nerve in osteoarthritis of spines\n\nReference-\n\nwww.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/complications-of-osteoarthritis-topic-overview", "Prevention":"This is observed that increase in the prevalence of obesity is largely due to the obesogenic environment rather than medical and genetic problems in the individuals.

At least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity physical activity on most days reduces the risk of obesity and co-morbidities.\n\n\tWHO has recommended that food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by:\n\n\n\t\treducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods;\n\n\t\tensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers;\n\n\t\trestricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; and\n\n\t\tensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets\n\nwww.who.int/features/factfiles/obesity", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Proptosis may be accentuated or precipitated by dependent head posture or by Valsalva manoeuvre.\n\n\tIt may be associated with vascular lesions of eyelids or conjunctiva, and may be of arterial or venous origin.\n\n\tThere may be enophthalmos due to fat atrophy.\n\n\tIt may show occasional bruising. There may be extensive involvement of peri-orbital or intra-cranial regions.\n\nHistopathology\n\n\tVarix is seen as one or more dilated veins, frequently with thrombosis and hyalinisation. Thrombosed varix may lead to pathologic reaction showing intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nInvestigations\n\n\nX-ray: X-ray may give evidence of calcification due to phlebolith.\n\nCT Imaging: An orbital varix has globular or smooth fusiform appearance, which enhances strongly with contrast medium. It increases in size on Valsalva manoeuvre on dynamic CT scanning.\n\nMRI Imaging: MRI signal depends upon presence of flow within varix. Patent lumen appears as an area of flow void on both T1 and T2-weighted scans. Contrast enhancement is variable and may be absent. Slow flow or thrombus in varix will give it a slight heterogeneous appearance.\n\nA and B-scan ultrasonography: There is increased size of the lesion on ultrasonography.\n\nVenography: This may demonstrate abnormal saccular vessels flowing out through venous channels.\n\nColour Doppler Imaging: This may be used to demonstrate an orbital varix. This is a non-invasive method of investigation.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis\n\n\tOrbital varix should be distinguished from other vascular lesions of the orbit such as\n\n\n\t\tHaemangioma.\n\n\t\tLymphangioma.\n\n\t\tIdiopathic orbital inflammation.\n\n\t\tCarotid-cavernous fistula.\n\n\t\tDural shunt.", "management":"Management of orbital varix is difficult.\n\n\tMost orbital varices are left as such and are observed over time.\n\nSurgical therapy\n\n\tSurgical excision is rather difficult.

Recurrence after subtotal excision is an issue of concern. Most patients remain stable without evidence of re-bleeding.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Prevention is a major strategy in addressing the disease burden of osteoarthritis; as no highly effective pharmaceutical treatments exist and surgical options are expensive and not widely available.\n\nPrimary prevention of OA includes:\n\nWeight control: Obesity is a risk factor for OA, thus maintaining or reducing weight through altered diet and increased physical exercise can lower the risk of developing OA.\n\nExercise- Regular physical activity according to individual\u2019s health status and lifestyle can keep the muscles around the joints strong and decreases the bone loss. Exercise needs to be directed for the entire body and not just the joints that are affected by OA. Both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities are recommended for people with arthritis. Exercise programme can be planned with the consultation of doctor.\n\nOccupational injury prevention: Repetitive use of joint should be avoided and proper management of related injuries can help prevent arthritis.\n\nSports injury prevention: Taking the necessary precautions to prevent injury such as warming up and using proper equipment can help reduce joint injuries.\n\nMisalignment: Improper alignment of the knee or hip can contribute to osteoarthritis and proper treatment such as orthotics or bracing can help reduce the risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe best way to prevent osteoarthritis is to exercise regularly, avoid squatting and cross-legged positions, maintain a healthy diet and keep weight in control.\n\nSecondary prevention:\n\n\tThe aim of secondary prevention is early diagnosis and effective and appropriate management that will minimize the health consequences of the disease.\n\nTertiary prevention:\n\n\tTertiary prevention is to minimize the complications of disease once it has been diagnosed. Such strategies are aimed at reducing pain and disability due to OA, and improving quality of life. Tertiary prevention strategies for OA include self-management (weight control, physical activity, and education), home help programmes, cognitive behavioural interventions, rehabilitation services, and medical or surgical treatments.\n\nHealthy eating for osteoarthritis-\n\nReduce extra calories: Take smaller portion, avoid sugar in foods and drinks, and eat mostly plant based foods.\n\nEat whole grains: Foods like oatmeal, brown rice and whole grain cereals.\n\nEat more fruits and vegetables, as they contain some antioxidants which may help reduce joint inflammation and reduce pain.\n\nAdd omega -3 fatty acids: \u00a0Omega-3 fatty acids may help relieve joint pain and decrease morning stiffness. Some of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids among fish groups are mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, tuna, salmon.\u00a0\u00a0 Flaxseeds, chia seeds, fish oils, eggs, cauliflower, canola oil, spinach are also good source of omega -3 fatty acids.\n\nUse olive oil instead of other oils: compound in olive oil called oleocanthal helps prevent inflammation.\n\nGet enough Vitamin C- Vitamin C helps build collagen and connective tissue. Eat foods like oranges, grapefruits and limes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEat Garlic- Compound like diallyl disulphide found in garlic may limit cartilage damaging enzymes in human cells.\n\nLow-fat dairy products (like milk, yogurt and cheese), and broccoli, and green tea are also effective in prevention of osteoarthritis.\n\nWatch high cooking temperature-Meat cooked at high temperature makes compounds called advanced glycation end products(AGEs), which are linked to inflammation(in diseases such as arthritis, heart disease and diabetes). Limit Grilled, fried, broiled, (food is cooked directly under high heat) and microwaved meats.

Lymphangioma is a benign vascular hamartoma commonly noticed in head and neck area. Vascular mesenchyme that has differentiated abnormaly into isolated lymphatic- like spaces with no connection to the systemic circulation,may be the cause. Lymphangioma is a common vascular tumour in children and commonly presents in age group less than ten years. However, it is, sometimes detected later in life following trauma and intralesional haemorrhage. There are two growth patterns of lymphangioma (slow or rapidly explosive). Slow enlargement takes place over decades, producing progressive proptosis. In contrast, explosive growth results from intralesional haemorrhage arising from intrinsic nutrient vessels, or in association with an upper respiratory tract infection with proliferation of lymphoid tissue. In contrast to capillary haemangioma, lymphangiomas do not regress spontaneously. These tumours may become encapsulated due to normal bodily reaction to prevent expansion.\n\n\tLymphangiomas do not show any connection to the venous system, as has been studied by arteriography or venography. This is in contrast to orbital varix, which usually show connections to the venous system.\n\n\tLike haemangiomas, Lymphangiomas may present in both superficial and deep orbital spaces. It consists of dilated, thin walled vascular chambers lined with endothelium. Fibrous stroma supports these and contain proteinaceous material reminiscent of lymph. There are micro-cystic, macro-cystic, or mixed types of Lymphangiomas.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nShields Jerry A, Shields Carol L.

Those who had more severe polio and who recovered more function are more likely to be strongly affected by PPS.\n\n\tAlthough the cause of PPS is debated, the common theory is that it is the result of the slow weakening of nerve cells in the spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. Overworking these weakened neurons over time leads to even more damage, eventually giving rise to PPS. Symptoms of PPS can appear anywhere from 10 to 40 years after initial polio attack. The average time of onset is about 30 years after initial polio attack.\n\n\tPPS is not an infectious disease- it cannot spread from one person to another.

IPV, is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on patient's age. Polio vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Most people should get polio vaccine when they are children. Children get 4 doses of IPV, at these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and booster dose at 4-6 years.\n\n\tOPV consists of a mixture of live, attenuated (weakened) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. Under the pulse polio immunization programme, all children below the age of 5 years are administered two doses of the oral polio vaccine per year. The oral polio vaccine is administered in the program, since it not only protects the child, but also gets disseminated to the community, thus resulting in widespread protection.\n\nReferences :\u00a0\n\nwww.nhs.uk\nwww.cdc.gov\u00a0\nwww.vaccineindia.org", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Vermiform or elastotic degeneration refers to wavy worm-like appearance of the degenerated fibers. Epithelium is usually normal, but may be acanthotic, hyperkeratotic or even dysplastic and often exhibits goblet cell hyperplasia. Typically, there is destruction of Bowman\u2019s layer and superficial stroma by fibro-vascular in-growth.\n\n\t\u00a0Pterygium shows an accumulation of degenerated sub-epithelial tissue which stains basophilic with a characteristic slate grey appearance on Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. This tissue also stains with elastic tissue stains, but it is not true elastic tissue, in that it is not digested by elastase.\n\nPterygium should be distinguished from:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pseudo-pterygium: A pseudo-pterygium results from corneal inflammation due to chemical or thermal burns, trauma, marginal corneal disease, corneal ulcer or corneal perforation with reparative process leading to adhesion of a fold of conjunctiva to peripheral cornea.\n\n\tPseudo-pterygium is differentiated from true pterygium by history of inflammation in affected eye, location may be other than horizontal meridian, configuration not resembling wing structure, usually unilateral, non progressive and ability to pass probe (probe test) under the neck of pterygium.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neoplasia: Neoplasia such as carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma should be excluded.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pinguecula: Pinguecula is an actinic lesion confined to the peri-limbal conjunctiva that does not extend onto the cornea. Pinguecula are commonly occurring, usually small and asymptomatic, often yellow, raised nodules appearing on the bulbar conjunctiva. These are found commonly on the nasal side, but can also be present on temporal aspect of limbus. Pinguecula can occasionally undergo inflammation with symptoms of itching, burning or mild pain.

PCOS is common diagnosis in women presenting with infertility.\u00a0 \u00a0The exact prevalence of PCOS is not known as the syndrome is not defined precisely. Prevalence of PCOS is highly variable ranging from 2.2% to 26% globally. In few Asian countries prevalence figures are ranging from 2% to 7.5% in China and 6.3% in Srilanka. There are few studies conducted in India. Studies done in South India and Maharashtra, prevalence of PCOS (by Rotterdam's criteria) were reported as 9.13% and 22.5% (10.7% by Androgen Excess Society criteria) respectively.\n\n\tPCOS was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, described as symptoms complex with amenorrhea, hirsutism, and enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts.\n\n\tPolycystic ovary syndrome causes irregular menstrual cycles, excessive body or facial hair and polycystic ovaries as its main symptoms. Polycystic means \"many cysts,\" and PCOS often causes clusters of small, pearl-sized cysts in the ovaries. The cysts are fluid-filled and contain immature eggs. Women with PCOS produce slightly higher amounts of male hormones known as androgens, which contribute to some of the symptoms of the condition.\n\n\tEarly diagnosis of PCOS is important as it has been linked to an increased risk for developing several medical conditions including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease.

 {"id":225, "name":"Sub-conjunctival Haemorrhage", "intro":"Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases.\n\n\tPAC may not be caused exclusively by seasonal allergens, although they may play a role. PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites, animal dander, moulds, cockroach dust, airborne allergens and cigarette smoke) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. About 79% of patients of PAC may still have seasonal exacerbations and is generally worse in the autumn when exposure to house dust mites, animal dander and fungal allergens is greatest. It is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high.\u00a0 Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.\n\n\tPAC and SAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although PAC and SAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.\n\n\tAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reaction upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by de-granulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). \u00a0\n\n\tPerennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In perennial and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement never occurs. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.\n\n\tPAC and SAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively.\n\nReferences:\n\n\tAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.Textbook of Ophthalmology Volume 1.First Edition.

In contrast, Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, caused by pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens.\n\n\tAcute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC de-granulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.\n\nPathophysiology:\n\n\tBoth PAC and SAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its de-granulation.\n\n\tAn allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to de-granulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.\n\n\tThere are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\n\tHistamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, tearing and stinging sensation, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).\n\n\tMC de-granulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.\n\n\tDe-granulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC de-granulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of PAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.\n\n\tImportant features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergic rhinitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bronchial asthma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atopic dermatitis.\n\n\tPatients with PAC are more likely to also have perennial rhinitis with features of sneezing and nasal discharge.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tSigns and symptoms of PAC (are usually milder and with longer duration) and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.\n\n\tPAC remains self-limited without ocular surface damage and is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to allergens.\n\n\tPAC is less common than SAC and, as patients are chronically exposed to allergen, symptoms and signs occur year-round. The most common triggers are mould spores, animal dander, and dust mites usually found in the household. Patients may also be sensitive to seasonal allergen with a superimposed offender to their symptoms. Because of the prolonged exposure, the conjunctiva may become boggy, chronically red, and irritated. Papillary hypertrophy along the tarsal conjunctival surface may occur with chronic exposure to allergens in PAC. The discharge is whitish but thick, and even stringy.\n\n\tMoulds, house dust, and animal dander participate in the disease process. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.\n\n\tDry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to \u2018wash away\u2019 the allergen is usually compromised.\n\n\tThe most significant symptom in allergic conjunctivitis is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.\n\n\tWithout itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.

The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.\n\n\tNormally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with PAC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conjunctival provocation test: Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending allergen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of PAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of PAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as PAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.\n\nPAC should be differentiated from conditions like:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact dermatitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toxic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\tManagement of PAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keeping household clean: Allergens in PAC are usually mould spores, animal dander, dust mites, and are predominantly found in the household. Therefore, carpets must be cleaned, changed or removed, as well as children\u2019s stuffed animals, soft toys, and curtains. The mattress top and sides must also be cleaned and enclosed in plastic bags or other dust mite proof cover. Sheets, pillows and blankets should be washed in hot water (54 degree Celsius). Pillows and the base of the bed must be vacuumed regularly. Pets should be kept out of the bedroom, and the bathroom should be kept clean and dry to inhibit mould growth.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air purifiers: While it is better to stop dust mites at the source, reducing the dust levels in the air could be an adequate strategy. Air purifiers that use high-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).\n\nSupportive measures:\n\n\tSupportive measures include:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cold compresses: Cold compresses decrease ocular inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Saline solutions: Irrigation of ocular surface with saline solution facilitates removal of allergens, and thus achieves the primary principle of allergy management by minimising exposure of the ocular surface to allergens.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears may be used to wash or dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators away from the ocular surface. In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild PAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoidance of eye rubbing. \n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tIt is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.\n\n\tMedical therapy includes:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (\u2018conjunctivitis medicamentosa\u2019) (Spector S & Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134\u2013136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations.\u00a0 Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of PAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of PAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the de-granulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of PAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC de-granulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines.\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating PAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. \u00a0Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Immune-modulators: Immune-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immune-modulator agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of PAC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:\n\n\t(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.\n\n\t(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.\n\n\t(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience adverse effects of medications, or\n\n\t(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPrognosis of PAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"PCOS cannot be prevented, but early diagnosis and treatment helps to prevent long-term complications, such as infertility, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\t\u00a0A healthy lifestyle consists of a healthy diet, regular\u00a0exercise and maintaining a healthy weight\u00a0is helpful in preventing various complications.

 {"id":226, "name":"Siderosis Bulbi", "intro":"Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis (PKC), Phlyctenular conjunctivitis, Phlyctenulosis or phlyctenular eye disease (PED) is an endogenous type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. It is an inflammatory condition which causes marked photophobia and mucopurulent discharge. PKC is characterised by sub-epithelial, single or multiple, gray-white, raised conjunctival or corneal nodules, generally at or near the limbus, surrounded by a zone of engorged hyperaemic vessels.\n\n\tThe description of phlyctenulosis dates back to early Greek and Arabic writings. (Thygeson P. The etiology and treatment of phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis. Am J Ophthalmol. 1951; 34:1217-36). The term phlyctenule comes from the Greek word \u2018phlyctena\u2019 which means blister. Sorsby and Thygeson have implicated a higher incidence of PKC amongst children and young adult (Sorsby A. The etiology of phlyctenular ophthalmia. Br J Ophthalmol. 1942; 26: 159-79).\n\n\tThe most common cause of PKC is a hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculoprotein, particularly in the developing world, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains endemic. However, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), Chlamydia, parasitic infection, fungal infection, and more recently, HLA subtypes A26, B35, and DR8 have also been demonstrated as causative agents. Other risk factors include those common to communicable disease such as malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, and sanitation. There is slight overall predilection towards female gender, although this varies depending on the primary aetiology of PKC. PKC is not a blinding disease but it is a source of lowered visual acuity.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nSihota Ramanjit, Tandon Radhika. Parson's Diseases of the Eye.

The disease is common in malnourished and debilitated children between five and twelve years of age. These children may suffer from enlarged tonsils, adenoids and cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n\tVarious aetiological factors which contribute to development of PKC are:\n\nBacteria:\n\n\n\t\tMycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n\t\tStaphylococcus aureus.\n\n\t\tPropionibacterium acnes.\n\n\t\tChlamydia trachomatis.\n\n\nParasites:\n\n\n\t\tAscaris lumbricoides.\n\n\t\tAncylostoma dudenale.\n\n\t\tHymenolepis nana.\n\n\t\tEntamoeba histolytica.\n\n\nFungi:\n\n\n\t\tCandida albicans.\n\n\t\tCoccidioides immitis.\n\n\nHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes:\n\n\n\t\tA26.\n\n\t\tB35.\n\n\t\tDR8.\n\n\nMeibomitis:\n\n\tPhlectenular keratitis may be associated with meibomitis ( Suzuki T, Mitsushi Y, Yoichiro S, et al. Phlectenular keratitis associated with meibomitis in young patients. Am J Ophthalmol. 2005; 140: 77-82).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis:\n\n\tM. tuberculosis is the most common cause of PKC worldwide, more so in the developing world, where tuberculosis remains endemic. \u00a0PKC can occur in:\n\n\n\t\tPatients with active or inactive tuberculosis.\n\n\t\tHistory of positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test or X-ray chest.\n\n\t\tFamily history of tuberculosis.\n\n\t\tPreclinical patients who will subsequently develop tuberculosis.\n\n\n\tTuberculosis related phlyctenulosis is more symptomatic and recurrent than phlyctenulosis caused by other pathogens. It frequently occurs as multiple lesions, and presents bilaterally in just over half of the cases, but may occur unilaterally as well. M. Tuberculosis is not being isolated from culture of ocular tissue. However, the diagnosis is made through systemic screening.\n\nStaphylococcus aureus:\n\n\tS. aureus is a more common cause of PKC in developed countries. Patients presenting with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) or chronic staphylococcal blepharoconjunctivitis are particularly susceptible. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation which may be substantiated with bacterial culture. It is less common and mild as compared to tuberculosis related PKC.\n\nPropionibacterium acnes:\n\n\tP.acnes is also linked to ocular surface inflammation (Suzuki T, Sano Y, Sasaki O, et al. Ocular surface inflammation induced by Propionibacterium acnes. Cornea.2002; 21: 812-7). Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and bacterial culture.\n\nHelminth infections:\n\n\tHelminth is more common than other parasitic infections. Helminths primarily affect limbus and cornea and spare conjunctiva. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction is produced due to eosinophilic response. With antihelminthic therapy, resolution of disease is faster than other infectious causes.\n\nGenetic association:\n\nSuzuki et al envisaged a genetic association of PKC. These include Human leukocyte antigen subtype (HLA) A26, B35, DR8. It is proposed that Human leukocyte antigen subtype (HLA) A26, B35 and DR8 play a specific role in the corneal helper T lymphocyte type I reaction that may produce phlyctenule lesions.\n\nMeibomitis:\n\nSuzuki et al. showed a preponderance of phlyctenulosis related to meibomitis in female patients (Suzuki T, Mitsushi Y, Yoichiro S, et al. Phlectenular keratitis associated with meibomitis in young patients. Am J Ophthalmol. 2005; 140: 77-82).They suggested a link between the expressions of sex steroid hormone receptors on the ocular surface, which predisposes females to PKC secondary to meibomitis.", "diagnosis":"Clinical signs may vary slightly according to the specific causative organism. It may occur either unilaterally or bilaterally in the conjunctiva, cornea or at limbus. The presence of phlycten on the palpebral conjunctiva is a rarity. Phlyctenulosis may also be an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients with a recent history of bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection.\n\n\tPhlyctenulosis begins as phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis or phlyctenular conjunctivitis. Phlyctenulosis rarely starts as keratitis only. Phlyctenular conjunctivitis is more common on bulbar than over palpebral conjunctiva, in association with hyperaemia and little discharge. Symptoms are often mild and many patients may have asymptomatic phlyctenulosis. Disease limited to the conjunctiva is self-limiting and usually resolves within two weeks.\n\n\tPKC presents as a small, round, elevated, grey or yellow, localised sub-epithelial infiltrate in the conjunctiva, limbus, or cornea, located adjacent to an area of hyperaemic blood vessels. Limbus is the most commonly affected site in PKC. In about two to three weeks time, these infiltrates ulcerate, leaving behind wedge-shaped fibro-vascular scars at limbus or in cornea. Phlyctenules of the conjunctiva do not form scars.\n\n\tDiagnosis requires examination under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.\n\nClinical signs of PKC:\n\n\n\t\tBlepharitis.\n\n\t\tMeibomitis.\n\n\t\tInflammation of conjunctiva or cornea.\n\n\t\tConjunctival or scleral injection.\n\n\t\tSub-epithelial conjunctival or corneal nodules surrounded by engorged hyperaemic blood vessels.\n\n\t\tPunctate epithelial keratopathy.\n\n\t\tPannus.\n\n\t\tNecrosis and ulceration of infiltrates.\n\n\t\tWedge-shaped fibro-vascular scar.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPhlyctenulosis may show patterns such as:\n\n\n\u2018Wandering phlyctenule\u2019: \u2018Wandering phlyctenule\u2019 is the most characteristic presentation of PKC. Limbal phlyctenule spreads across the cornea paracentrally and perpendicular to the limbus, leaving behind a superficial and vascular scar in its place.\n\nMarginal ulcers: Marginal ulcers may occur in which phlyctenulosis starts at the limbus and progresses to the cornea without leaving behind a clear space between the limbus and ulcer.\n\nDiffuse central pattern: A diffuse central pattern without ulceration often occurs in recurrent disease. This may lead to an in-growth of superficial or deep vessels.\n\nPannus: There may be pannus formation in PKC. Pannus of PKC is distinguished from trachomatous pannus by the presence of diffuse central infiltrates and vessels which run straight from the limbus to the cornea.\n\nMiliary disease: In miliary disease, small phlyctenules cover the surface of the cornea. It is rarely seen.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistological studies:\n\n\tPhlyctenules are sub-epithelial inflammatory infiltrates that contain cells such as histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. The basal epithelium overlying these nodular infiltrates is composed of mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils and Langerhans cells.\n\n\tThe inflammation in phlyctenular infiltrates is a delayed hypersensitivity response that predominantly has monocyte derived cells. Phlycten shows a characteristic sub-epithelial mononuclear infiltration in a triangular area, the apex being directed towards deeper layers of cornea. There is cuffing around stromal blood vessels with sub-epithelial mononuclear, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Perivascular infiltrate transforms into macrophages and finally into dendritic cells that react with monoclonal antibodies. Helper and inducer T-lymphocytes become sensitised, leading to the generation of activated T-cells and finally the release of lymphokines. Lymphokines cause an influx of inflammatory cells.

Other antibiotics which may be used are gatifloxacin, bacitracin, and azithromycin.\n\nAnti-tubercular therapy:\n\n\tIn tuberculosis associated PKC, patients should be screened for underlying active infection, and are treated with the appropriate anti-tubercular medical therapy. Family members or close contacts should also be screened and treated.\n\nAnti-parasite medicines: \n\n\tPatients with helminthic infections should be treated with parasite-specific oral medication like mebendazole.

 {"id":227, "name":"Tetanus", "intro":"Plague is a communicable disease, caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is one of the oldest diseases known to man and still occurs in the tropics, subtropics and warmer areas of temperate countries. Past outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent.\n\n\tPlague is primarily a zoonotic disease (transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans)\n\n\tof wild rodents and man is affected incidentally. It is transmitted from one rodent to another by fleas (ectoparasites) and from animals to humans either by the bite of infected fleas, or direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials when handling infected hosts.\n\n\tWidespread pandemics (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population) of plague have occurred in past with high mortality. It was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing an estimated 50 million deaths. Nearly half of deaths were in Asia and Africa and the other half were in Europe.\n\n\tPlague is endemic (a disease that occurs regularly in a particular area) in many countries in Africa, former Soviet Union, Americas and Asia. The distribution of plague coincides with the geographical distribution of the rodents it infects, which are found in all continents except Australia.\n\n\tPlague epidemics (unusually high occurrence of a disease in a population or area) have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. In 2013 there were 783 cases reported worldwide, including 126 deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 20 countries in Africa, America, and Asia are identified as natural foci for plague. The 3 most endemic countries are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. In Madagascar, outbreaks have occurred nearly every year since 1980.\n\n\tIn India, outbreaks of plague occurred in Mamla village of district Beed, Maharashtra state (bubonic type) and district Surat in Gujarat state (pneumonic type) in September 1994. Subsequently, suspected cases of pneumonic plague were reported from Delhi, Varanasi, Karnataka and other states. A total of 876 cases and 54 deaths were reported. In 2002, outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Himachal Pradesh with 16 cases and 4 deaths. In 2004, outbreak of bubonic plague was reported from Dangud village, of district Uttar Kashi, Uttarakhand state with 8 cases & 3 deaths. \u00a0\n\n\tThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi has identified four sylvatic foci (affecting wild animals) in India; the tri-junction of south India (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. NCDC is keeping routine surveillance in these areas.\n\n\tWeak health systems and low standards of environmental hygiene are risk factors for outbreaks of human plague. As with many primarily zoonotic diseases, plague is a very severe disease in people, with case fatality rates of 50-60% if left untreated.\n\nReferences- \n\nwho.int/csr/disease/plague/madagascar-outbreak/en/\n\n\tMittal V et al,Quick control of bubonic plague outbreak in Uttar Kashi, India.

Disease starts with flu like symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.\n\n\tDepending on the route of infection, there are three forms of plague: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.\n\n\nBubonic\u00a0plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea usually on the lower extremities. Plague bacillus\u00a0(Y. pestis), enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it proliferates. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, swollen and is called a \"bubo\". The most usual place for this swelling is the groin, but it also occurs in the armpits and the neck. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. Bubonic plague cannot spread from person to person.\n\n\n\nSepticaemic\u00a0plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a \u201cbubo\". Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestis\u00a0in the blood.\n\n\n\nPneumonic\u00a0plague-or lung-based plague- It is less common form of plague and is caused by spread of infection to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. It is highly infectious and can spread from human to human via infected air droplets or through infected clothing and other contaminated articles. Untreated pneumonic plague has a very high case-fatality ratio.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwho.int/mediacentre/factsheets/", "causes":"Plague is caused by Yersinia pestis (non-motile, non-acid fast, non spore forming, gram-negative cocco-bacillus). Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nVectors of plague- Fleas are the natural vectors of plague in the world. In India, the important fleas for plague transmission are Xenopsylla cheopis, X. astia and X. brasiliensis. Out of these X. cheopis is the principal vector.\n\nReservoir of infection \u2013 Wild rodents are the natural hosts of Y. pestis. At least 220 species of rodents which inhabit mountains, plains, deserts, cultivated fields and forests in both temperate and tropical climate are known to be infected with plague bacillus. Tatera indica among the wild rodents and Rattus norvegicus and R.rattus among the commensal rodents play an important role as reservoir of Y. pestis. In India Tatera indica acts as a main reservoir of infection, not the domestic rat (R.rattus).Generally the infection is maintained by the resistant species of the wild rodents. The susceptible rodents die due to the disease. \u00a0\n\nMode of transmission-\n\nFlea bites-Plague bacteria are mostly transmitted by bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics (occurrence of disease at higher rates than expected, in animal population), many rodents die, and causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primary\u00a0bubonic or septicaemic plague.\n\nContact with contaminated fluid or tissue- Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal without using proper precautions such as hunters. This type of transmission results in bubonic plague or septicaemic plague.\n\nInfectious droplets- Infected droplets from a case of pneumonic plaque can infect other person. Contact with infected cats can transmit the infection to humans by droplet infection. \u00a0\n\nReferences-\n\ncdc.gov/plague/transmission/index.html\n\nwho.int/csr/resources/publications/plague/CSR\n\nnicd.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/zoonotic", "diagnosis":"When plague is suspected, clinical specimens should be collected immediately and specific antimicrobial treatment should be started before confirmation of laboratory diagnosis.

Presence of bacilli can be confirmed by Bacteriophage Lysis Test.\n\nSerology- Presence of a single high titre of plague antibody in individual who has not been vaccinated earlier gives a presumptive diagnosis of plague. Whereas a fourfold rise in antibody in two serum samples collected at least 10 days apart gives the confirmation of plague diagnosis. \u00a0\n\nOther tests- Polymerase Chain Reaction for the detection of selected Yesinia pestis genes, ELISA based rapid serological tests, animal inoculation.\n\nLaboratory diagnostic categories for human plague are as follows:\n\nCase definitions:\n\nSuspect plague: \u00a0\n\n\n\t\tCompatible clinical and epidemiological features; and\n\n\t\tSuspicious organisms seen or isolated from clinical specimens.\n\n\nPresumptive plague:\n\n\n\t\tY. pestis F1 antigen detected in clinical materials by direct fluorescent antibody testing, or by some other standardized antigen detection method; or\n\n\t\tisolate from a clinical specimen demonstrates biochemical reactions consistent with Y. pestis or Polymerase chain reaction(PCR) positivity; or\n\n\t\t\u00a0a single serum specimen is found positive for diagnostic levels of antibodies to Y. pestis F1 antigen, not explainable on the basis of prior infection or immunization.\n\n\nConfirmed plague: \n\n\n\t\tisolate identified as Y. pestis by phage lysis of cultures; or\n\n\t\ta significant (a 4-fold or greater) change in antibody titre to the F1 antigen in paired serum specimens\n\n\n\tPost-mortem specimens, specimens from rodent tissues, flea specimens, and soil specimens are also used to determine the eco-epidemiology of the infection.\n\nReferences-\n\nnicd.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/zoonotic\n\ncdc.gov/plague/diagnosis/", "management":"As the disease is fatal early diagnosis and treatment is essential for the good prognosis of the patient.\n\n\tWhen human plague is suspected on clinical and epidemiological grounds, appropriate specimens/samples for laboratory confirmation of disease should be obtained immediately.\n\n\tThe patient should be started on specific antimicrobial therapy without waiting for a definitive answer from the laboratory.\n\n\tSuspect plague patients with evidence of pneumonia should be placed in isolation, and should be managed under respiratory droplet precautions.\n\nReference-\n\nwho.int/csr/resources/publications/plague/", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Measures taken to prevent Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis may be:\n\n\n\t\tTreat infected tonsils and adenoids and improve general health of the child.\n\n\t\tPatients with tubercular or staphylococcal diseases should be desensitised against the corresponding antigens.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":228, "name":"Thalassaemia", "intro":"Pinguecula (derived from Latin word pinguis, which means fat) represents an area of bulbar conjunctival thickening adjoining limbus in the palpebral fissure area. Pinguecula are less transparent than normal conjunctiva and often have a fatty appearance. They are usually bilateral, triangular, elevated, white to yellow in colour, horizontally oriented, and are located nasally much more often than temporally. They may also present on both the nasal and temporal conjunctiva in the eyes of some patients. Pinguecula does not cross the limbus, and current information suggests that pinguecula does not progress to pterygium and that the two are distinct disorders.\n\n\tPinguecula are associated with a two to three fold increase in incidence of age-related macular degeneration, possibly through a common light exposure effect (Pham TQ et al).\n\n\tDegenerations of the conjunctiva are common conditions that, in most cases, have relatively little effect on ocular function and vision. These conditions increase in prevalence with increasing age as a result of past inflammation, of long-term toxic effects of environmental exposure, or of ageing itself. Conjunctival degenerations may be associated with chronic irritation, dryness, or previous history of trauma.\n\nReferences:\n\nSundaram Venki, Barsam Allon, Alwitry Amar, Khaw Peng T.

Pinguecula are more common than pterygium.\n\n\tEvidence suggests its association with:\n\n\nIncreasing age: Pinguecula are seen in most of the patients by 70- 80 years of age.\n\nUltraviolet light exposure: Chronic sunlight exposure (actinic damage due to both ultraviolet A and B light) is associated with outdoor work and equatorial residence. Association with light exposure is found in welders, who have higher rate of pinguecula as compared to non-welders. Possibly, predominantly nasal location is related to reflection of light from the nose onto the nasal conjunctiva. The effect of ultraviolet light may be mediated by mutations in gene p53.\n\nGaucher\u2019s disease (inherited lipid storage disease): Pigmented, brown, triangular pinguecula may appear during second decade of Gaucher\u2019s disease. Biopsy from the lesions shows Gaucher cells. Patients with Gaucher\u2019s disease may show associated congenital oculomotor apraxia and white retinal infiltrates. There may be corneal opacities in posterior two-thirds of the stroma. The genetic defect in Gaucher\u2019s disease lies on chromosome 1q21.", "diagnosis":"The diagnosis is usually clinical and may require slit-lamp biomicroscopy.\n\nClinical features:\n\n\n\t\tPinguecula are located in the anterior bulbar conjunctiva adjacent to the limbus.\n\n\t\tPinguecula are located in the inter-palpebral zone, usually more nasally than temporally.\n\n\t\tUsually, there is no corneal involvement. However, there may be punctate epithelial erosions or dellen (thinning of adjacent peripheral part of cornea due to drying).\n\n\t\tA grading system showed no significant difference in nasal versus temporal size.\n\n\t\tPinguecula are yellowish-white sub-epithelial deposits with possible calcifications.\n\n\t\tOccasionally pinguecula may become inflamed (called pingueculitis) and irritated due to surface drying. The lesion may become highly vascularised and injected.\n\n\nHistopathology:\n\n\tPinguecula are characterised by elstotic degeneration of the collagen with hyalinisation of the conjunctival stroma, collection of basophilic elastotic fibers, and granular deposits.\n\n\n\t\tThe sub-epithelial tissue shows senile elastosis (basophilic degeneration) and irregular, dense sub-epithelial concretions. The elastotic material stains positively for elastin but is not sensitive to elastase (elastotic degeneration).\n\n\t\tThe elastotic material is positive for elastin, microfibrillar protein, and amyloid P. These components never normally co-localise.\n\n\n\tThe control of elastogenesis is seriously defective so that elastic fibers are abnormal in biochemical organisation. Normal assembly of elastic fibers is prevented due to marked reduction of elastic microfibrils. Limbal epithelial cell mutations at gene p53, probably due to ultraviolet irradiation, may be an early event in the development of pinguecula. The sub-epithelial dense concretions stain positively for lysozyme. Pinguecula may calcify with time.\n\nElectron microscopy:\n\n\tUnder electron microscopy, the granular material consists of hollow- centered microfibrils, which are elastic fiber precursors. The material is overproduced by numerous fibroblasts that are thought to be actinically activated by sunlight exposure.\n\nImmunoassay:\n\n\tImmunoassay suggests an abnormal epidermal differentiation due to a decline in the expression of Pax6, K19 keratin, and MUC5AC (a protein coding gene), but an associated increase in K10 and K14 keratin. There is also active proliferation of the squamous cells, as evidenced by positive expression of Ki67, P63, and K16 keratin.\n\n\tPinguecula may become inflamed due to dryness and irritation, resulting in so-called pingueculitis. The most common causes of such inflammation are:\n\n\nMechanical irritation: Irritation by the edge of a contact lens is a frequent cause.\n\nOcular surface disease. \n\n\n\tThe epithelium overlying a pinguecula can vary from atrophic and thinned to hyperplastic and thickened. Pinguecula are unlikely to undergo malignant conversion. However, a lesion that looks atypical should be approached with suspicion. Actinic keratosis, dysplastic changes, and even carcinoma can arise within the epithelium overlying a pinguecula.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPinguecula may be differentiated from:\n\n\n\t\tLimbal dermoid.\n\n\t\tConjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia.\n\n\t\tConjunctival tumour like naevus, melanoma or papilloma.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tManagement includes:\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\nElimination of the causal factor.\n\nArtificial tears: Increased lubrication with artificial tears.\n\nTopical corticosteroids: Short course (to avoid adverse side-effects) of topical steroids may be given when inflammation is significant.\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used in cases of associated inflammation.\n\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\nSimple excision: Chronically inflamed or cosmetically unsatisfactory pingueculae rarely warrant simple excision.\n\nLaser photocoagulation: Laser photocoagulation may be used to remove pinguecula.\n\n\n\tSteroids or surgical excision are discouraged unless there is chronic irritation or interference with the use of contact lens.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPinguecula may grow slowly over time but are associated with minimal ocular morbidity (a diseased state).", "complications":"Potential possible complications of pinguecula are:\n\n\n\t\tPinguecula can slowly enlarge to become inflamed and irritating (Pingueculitis).\n\n\t\tRestriction of extra-ocular movement.\n\n\t\tAstigmatism.\n\n\t\tDellen.\n\n\t\tDysplastic changes and even carcinoma can arise within the epithelium overlying a pinguecula.\n\n\t\tMay progress to chronic actinic keratopathy.", "Prevention":"Prevention and control of human plague transmission-\n\n\tPrevention and control of human plague transmission is a multidisciplinary approach.

Almost 1 million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (2013). Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. In India, out of 27 million babies born every year (2010 data), 3.5 million babies born are premature.\n\n\tNewborn deaths (those in the first month of life) account for 40 percent of all deaths among children under five years of age. Preterm birth is the world\u2019s number one cause of newborn deaths, and the second leading cause of all child deaths under five, after pneumonia.\n\n\tMany of the preterm babies who survive suffer from various disabilities like cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory illnesses. The morbidity associated with preterm birth often extends to later life, resulting in physical, psychological and economic stress to the individual and the family.\n\n\tThough occurrence of preterm birth is a global problem, but more than 60% of preterm births occur in Africa and South Asia. In the lower-income countries, on average, 12% of babies are born too early compared with 9% in higher-income countries. Within countries, poorer families are at higher risk. Survival of premature babies also depends on where they are born; almost 9 out of every 10 preterm babies survive in high-income countries because of enhanced basic care and awareness, in sharp contrast to about 1 out of 10 in low-income countries.\n\n\tMore than three-quarters of preterm /premature babies can be saved with often inexpensive care such as essential care during child birth, antenatal steroid injections (given to pregnant women at risk of preterm labour under set criteria to strengthen the babies\u2019 lungs) and postnatal care like kangaroo mother care (the baby is carried by the mother with skin-to-skin contact and frequent breastfeeding), and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.\n\n\tIdentification\u00a0of risk factors in women with improved care before, between and during pregnancies; better access to contraceptives and increased empowerment/ education can further decrease the preterm birth rate (the number of preterm births divided by the number of live births).\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/topics/preterm_birth\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/\n\nwww.savethechildren.in/news", "symtoms":"Preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy or fewer than 259 days of gestation are completed since the first day of a woman\u2019s last menstrual period (LMP).

The safest time for referral to such type of hospital is when the baby is still in the womb.\n\n\tOnce preterm labor has started, there are interventions that can prolong pregnancy and improve health outcomes and survival for the premature baby. Interventions to prolong pregnancy include the provision of tocolytic agents that inhibit uterine contractions to suppress labor (e.g., oxytocin antagonists, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate).\n\n\tThe other three interventions that can be provided during the pregnancy period will help in improving health outcomes of the premature baby: antenatal corticosteroids, antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and magnesium sulphate.\n\n\nUse of antenatal corticosteroids- Women in preterm labour, before 34 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, should receive steroid injections to speed up the development of the baby\u2019s lungs. The administration of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth (as early as 23 weeks) can reduce the premature baby\u2019s risk of death, respiratory distress and developmental problems.\n\nUse of antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)- Premature rupture of the membranes is strongly associated with infection of the amniotic membranes contributing to preterm birth and other poor fetal outcomes such as cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease. Antibiotic treatment for PPROM may delay onset of labor for up to 48 hours and reduce neonatal infections.\n\n\n\t\u00a0(Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination (such as co-amoxiclav) should be avoided in women at risk of preterm delivery because of the increased risk of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.*)\n\n\nUse of magnesium sulphate- The administration of magnesium sulphate to women at risk of preterm birth before 32 weeks of gestation helps to protect the baby\u2019s brain, reduce rates of cerebral palsy and improve long-term neonatal health outcomes.\n\n\n(b)Special care for newborn (preterm) baby-\n\nPreterm baby needs special care because -\n\n\tPreterm babies are not fully developed to live in the world outside their mother\u2019s womb. Therefore they need special care along with same care that other babies get to overcome the following challenges- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nKeeping warm:\n\n\tPreterm babies lose body heat more easily, which may result in to hypothermia. Hence they need extra energy and care to stay warm and grow. Babies should be kept warm right after birth; they should be dried thoroughly and placed on their mother\u2019s abdomen. After the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut and if they breathe normally they should be put on their mother\u2019s chest, with skin-to-skin contact, until after the first breastfeed. They should not be bathed right away.\n\nBreathing:\n\n\tThe lungs of preterm babies are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs expanded). Many preterm babies start breathing on their own, when they are born, but others need to be resuscitated (newborn resuscitation or ventilation with a bag and mask). If breathing problems persist, they may need additional support from a machine (ventilator) and extra oxygen.Sometimes, some premature babies that have started breathing are not strong enough to continue on their own and exhaust themselves and may stop breathing (apnoea). Constant supervision is required for such babies.\n\nFeeding:\n\n\tPreterm babies may need additional support for feeding as the coordinated suck and swallow reflex is not yet fully developed. Breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm babies. Babies should be breastfed as soon as possible after birth. Most premature babies who are unable to coordinate the suck and swallow reflex can be fed their mother\u2019s expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or nasogastric tube. Breast is best: just like full-term babies.\n\nInfections:\n\n\tThe immune systems of preterm babies are not fully developed therefore they are more susceptible to infections. If they get an infection, they have a higher risk of dying.\n\n\tPreterm babies should be protected from infections by:\n\n\n\t\tGloves and cutting devices used for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord should be sterile,\n\n\t\tEveryone who touches the mother or the baby should have clean hands.\n\n\t\tMedical examinations and procedures should only be done if necessary.\n\n\t\tBabies who have infections need treatment with antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nBrain:\n\n\tPreterm babies are at risk of bleeding in the brain, during birth and in the first few days after birth. Lack of oxygen can also cause brain injuries. Bleeding or lack of oxygen to the brain can result in cerebral palsy, developmental delays and learning difficulties\n\nEyes:\n\n\tPreterm babies\u2019 eyes can be damaged by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. The condition is usually more severe in very premature babies and if they are given too-high a level of oxygen. This can result in visual impairment or blindness.\n\nCare for preterm babies with complications:\n\n\tBabies who have additional complications may need to be kept in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Hospitals with NICU can provide specialized care for newborn babies with serious health problems. They have special equipments and specially trained doctors and nurses who provide around-the-clock care for preterm babies, who need extra support to keep warm, to breathe and to be fed, or who are very sick.\n\n\tAs preterm babies (and full-term babies with low birth weight) need extra warmth and support for feeding, Kangaroo Mother Care is a good technique for these babies, if they do not have other serious problems (breathing well with normal heart rate).\n\nKangaroo Mother Care: is a technique by which the baby is held on an adult\u2019s chest\u2014usually the mother\u2014with skin-to-skin contact, for extended periods of time. The baby is placed on his/her mother\u2019s chest and stays there, day and night, held in place by a cloth that is wrapped and tied at the mother\u2019s back. It is an effective way to meet a premature baby\u2019s needs for warmth, frequent breastfeeding, protection from infection, stimulation, safety and love. It also improves bonding between mothers and babies.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\nhwww.who.int/features\n\nwww.who.int/features/qa\n\n/www.who.int/features/qa\n\napps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_", "complications":"Because preterm/premature babies are not yet fully developed, they may suffer from various complications such as:\n\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS): as the lungs of premature baby are immature and lack surfactant in the alveoli, babies may develop RDS.

This risk can be reduced by antenatal corticosteroids injections to women at risk of preterm labor, or in preterm labor.\n\nFeeding difficulties: since the coordinated suck and swallow process only starts at 34 weeks of gestation, preterm babies are more likely to aspirate. They need help to feed.\n\nJaundice is more common in premature babies since the immature liver cannot easily metabolize bilirubin.

It is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality (number of stillbirths and deaths of newborn in the first week of life) and morbidity.\n\n\tHypertensive disorders of pregnancy occur in about 10% of all pregnant women around the world. Preeclampsia affects 3\u20135% of pregnancies. Along with preeclampsia, other diseases which are included in the group of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are eclampsia, gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension.\n\n\tIn Asia and Africa, nearly one tenth of all maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\n\n\tIn India, the incidence of preeclampsia is reported to be 8-10% among the pregnant women.

Prolonged bed rest for the duration of pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism (formation of a clot (thrombus) in a blood vessel that may break loose and may obstruct another vessel).\n\nTiming of delivery: In women with preeclampsia without severe features between 34 weeks of gestation and 37 weeks of gestation should be in favour of continued monitoring and delivery to 37 completed weeks of gestation ( in the absence of abnormal foetal testing or other severe conditions such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour, or vaginal bleeding).\n\n\tDelivery is indicated in the following conditions:\n\n\n\t\t37 or more weeks of gestation\n\n\t\tSuspected abruptio placentae (detachment of placenta from uterus)\n\n\t\t34 weeks or more of gestation, plus any one of the following:\n\n\t\tProgressive labour or rupture of membranes\n\n\t\tUltrasonographic estimate of foetal weight less than fifth percentile\n\n\t\tOligohydramnios (less amount of amniotic fluid )\n\n\t\tPersistent biophysical profile 6/10 or less (upper limit 10/10)\n\n\n\tIn women with preeclampsia, a delivery decision should not be based on the amount of proteinuria or change in the amount of proeteinuria only, but all other indicated tests should be kept under consideration\n\nMagnesium sulfate prophylaxis should be initiated if there is progression to severe disease.\n\nManagement of Severe preeclampsia-\n\n\tFor women with preeclampsia with severe hypertension during pregnancy (sustained systolic BP of at least 160 mm of Hg or diastolic BP of at least 110 mm Hg),the use of anti hypertensive therapy is recommended.\n\n\tIn pregnancy with severe preeclampsia, the parenteral (intravenous/intramuscular) administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended.\n\n\tIn women with severe preeclampsia at term, early delivery is recommended.\n\n\tFor women with severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks of gestation with stable maternal and foetal conditions, it is advised that pregnancy should be continued at facilities with adequate maternal and neonatal intensive care units. Whenever there is an indication, delivery may be considered. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tFor women with severe preeclampsia at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation and with unstable maternal and foetal conditions irrespective of gestational age, quick delivery is recommended after maternal stabilization.\n\n\tPregnancy with severe preeclampsia before 23-24 weeks of gestation, delivery after maternal stabilization is recommended. Expectant management is not advised.\n\nAntenatal corticosteroid administration should be considered in women with severe preeclampsia receiving expectant management at 34 weeks or less of gestation for foetal lung maturity.\n\nThe mode of delivery: should be determined by foetal gestational age, foetal presentation, cervical status, and maternal- foetal condition.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.acog.org\n\napps.who.int", "complications":"Women who have preeclampsia during pregnancy are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy (antenatal), during child birth (intrapartum) and after child birth (puerperium)).

 {"id":231, "name":"Toxic Keratoconjunctivitis", "intro":"Pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) is a bilateral (may be asymmetric), progressive, inferior crescentic peripheral thinning of the cornea. There is no vascularisation, infiltration or scarring in the area of involved cornea. Band of thinning measures about 1 to 2mm in width and extends from 4 to 8 o\u2019clock position (about 6 to 8mm), leaving a normal band of 1 to 2mm from the limbus. The condition affects both men and women between 20 to 40 years of age. The condition results in high irregular astigmatism and rarely may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane) or even perforation. It differs from keratoconus in that it has no iron ring, its thinning is in inferior part without a cone; and the corneal protrusion is located above (rather than) in the area of thinning. Pellucid marginal degeneration and keratoconus may exist in the same eye and in different eyes of the same patient. This association in the same patient suggests that pellucid marginal degeneration, keratoconus and keratoglobus (generalised thinning and globular protrusion of the cornea) may be varying spectrum of the same pathophysiology rather than separate disease processes. The central cornea is usually of normal thickness, and the epithelium overlying the area of thinning is intact. Rarely, it may involve superior part of cornea.\n\nSchalaeppi (1957), coined the term pellucid marginal degeneration to describe a progressive and non-inflammatory peripheral corneal thinning disorder. The word \u2018pellucid\u2019, meaning clear, was used to denote the clarity of the cornea in this condition despite the presence of ectasia.\n\n\tThe cause of pellucid marginal degeneration is not clearly established, but collagen abnormalities such as that occur in keratoconus have been reported. The condition is rare, but there may be a considerable underestimation of the incidence because these patients are often misdiagnosed as having keratoconus. Early cases of pellucid marginal degeneration may be diagnosed with corneal topography/videokeratography (maps the surface curvature of the cornea) only.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nBasak Samar K.

Due to the concomitant presence of PMD with keratoconus in the same eye, many have proposed that PMD is a peripheral form of keratoconus.\n\n\tTo date, there is no evidence that PMD is genetically inherited.\n\n\tSeveral conditions have been reported in patients with PMD, but none of them show an obvious pathogenic association.\n\nAssociated conditions: \n\n\n\t\tChronic open angle glaucoma.\n\n\t\tRetinal lattice degeneration.\n\n\t\tScleroderma.\n\n\t\tRetinitis pigmentosa.\n\n\t\tKeratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t\tEczema.\n\n\t\tHyperthyroidism.\n\n\n\tThe exact pathophysiology of PMD has not been ascertained, but it is thought to be secondary to collagen abnormalities of cornea, similar to keratoconus.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon history, slit-lamp examination, pachymetry (measures thickness of the cornea) and corneal topography.\n\n\tPatients with PMD typically present with progressive reduction in vision or longstanding poor vision, resulting from large magnitude of irregular, against-the-rule astigmatism. Against-the-rule astigmatism is the condition in which horizontal meridian is steepest and it can be corrected by a minus cylinder in the vertical axis or the plus cylinder in the horizontal axis. There may be sudden reduction in vision and photophobia due to acute hydrops, being produced by breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\n\tPMD is a bilateral condition but unilateral cases have also been described. This condition most commonly involves inferior cornea, but involvement of superior, nasal and temporal quadrants of cornea has been reported as well.\n\nClinical signs of PMD:\n\n\nRefraction and keratometry: Refraction and keratometry shows against-the-rule astigmatism.\n\nPMD features: PMD is characterised by a typical narrow, clear band of corneal thinning about 1 to 2mm in width which extends from 4-o\u2019clock position to 8-o\u2019clock position (6 to 8mm in size). The degree of thinning is usually severe and may cause up to 80% loss of stromal tissue. Between limbus and thinned band-like region there is typically a 1 to 2mm wide region of uninvolved normal cornea which is usually clear. The corneal protrusion is most marked just superior to the area of thinning and usually with normal thickness of the central cornea. Descemet\u2019s folds, usually concentric with the inferior limbus, may develop which disappear with pressure on the cornea.\n\n\n\tUnlike keratoconus, PMD usually does not show signs of Fleischer\u2019s ring, corneal infiltration, vascularisation, scarring or lipid deposition. Since there is no obvious cone, cornea does not exhibit Munson\u2019s sign (a V-shaped deformation of the lower eyelid when the eye turns downward) or Rizutti\u2019s sign (a sharply focussed beam of light near nasal limbus produced by lateral illumination of the temporal limbus).\n\n\nCorneal topography or videokeratography: Corneal topography is the gold standard in detecting corneal ectasia. The use of topography allows the detection of early and subclinical ectasia which is important in diagnosis as well as in pre-operative corneal laser refractive surgery assessment. Videokeratography shows low corneal power along the central vertical axis which increases as the inferior cornea is approached, and high corneal power along the inferior oblique meridians. There are various topography devices like TMS-1 which uses pacido rings method, Orbscan II utilises slit-scanning and Placido ring reflection, Oculus Pentacam uses Scheimpflug photography for topography with pachymetry, and Visante Omni combines Placido ring and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for topography with pachymetry. The hallmark of corneal topography in PMD is an obvious flattening of the cornea along the vertical meridian. Inferior-central cornea in PMD shows a \u2018beer-belly\u2019 appearance when viewed from the side. Topography shows that this inferior peripheral steepening extends into the mid-peripheral, inferior oblique corneal meridians in a classic \u2018crab-claw\u2019, \u2018butterfly\u2019 or \u2018kissing doves\u2019 appearance.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nClassification or stages of PMD:\n\n\tBeing a rare disorder no clearly defined, guidelines have been proposed to categorise the severity of the condition. However, the ectatic process advances over time and it is suggested to have three stages:\n\n\n\t\tMild.\n\n\t\tModerate.\n\n\t\tAdvanced.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology:\n\nLight microscopy may show irregularity in epithelium with oedema, increase in stromal mucopolysaccharides as well as an irregular Bowman\u2019s membrane with ruptures at places. There may be folds in Descemet\u2019s membrane and stromal thinning.\n\nElectron microscopy may show breaks in Bowman\u2019s layer, irregular arrangement of stroma with the presence of extracellular, granular electron-dense deposits. There is absence of inflammatory cells.\n\nScanning electron microscopy may reveal unusual electron-dense areas of fibrous long-spacing collagen in the peripheral thinned areas, scattered amongst regions of mostly normal collagen.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n\n\tPMD is most frequently misdiagnosed as the more common corneal ectatic condition of keratoconus.\n\n\nKeratoconus: Keratoconus is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone.\u00a0 Pellucid marginal degeneration may be differentiated from keratoconus in most cases by the inferior band like location of the thinning on slit lamp (bio-microscopy) examination and by the classic butterfly pattern on videokeratography. In contrast to keratoconus, patients with pellucid marginal degeneration have no iron ring, no Vogt striae, and no central corneal thinning or scarring of the protruding cornea, and corneal protrusion is located above rather than in the area of thinning.\n\nKeratoglobus: Keratolobus causes circumferential 360\u02da thinning of the cornea, more marked at the limbus, and the entire cornea protrudes compared with regional thinning in keratoconus and inferior paralimbal thinning in pellucid marginal degeneration. Corneas with keratoglobus usually show diffuse thinning, varying from one-third to one-fifth of the normal corneal thickness at the mid-peripheral area. Vogt\u2019s striae, sub-epithelial scarring, Fleischer\u2019s ring, lipid deposition and corneal vascularisation are rarely found in the corneas with keratoglobus. The cornea can also become opaque and oedematous from breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane.\n\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration: Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory condition characterised by slowly progressive, bilateral, marginal corneal ectasia typically beginning superiorly which can then progress circumferentially. Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration most commonly affects males in their mid-twenties. Early signs on slit lamp examination include marginal opacification with peripheral vascularisation. Marginal thinning then begins parallel to the limbus, forming a \u2018gutter-like furrow\u2019 in the clear gap between opacification and limbus. Epithelium remains intact and does not ulcerate over the furrow and lipid deposition occurs as the furrow deepens. Pseudo-pterygium may develop near the furrowed area. As the disease continues, the thinning may extend to the inferior cornea, sparing the interpalpebral periphery. There is relative steepening of interpalpebral peripheral cornea, resulting in against-the-rule or oblique astigmatism. Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration progresses very slowly, frequently taking several years. Vast majority of patients with Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration complain of mild, intermittent ocular irritation only. Very rarely does it causes acute ocular inflammation with pain.\n\nFurrow degeneration: Furrow degeneration, like pellucid marginal degeneration has an intact epithelium and the area of corneal thinning is not vascularised, at least in the acute phase. The area of thinning in furrow degeneration is much closer to the limbus with virtually no intervening zone of normal cornea. Furrow degeneration may on occasion involve superior part of cornea, and there may be an associated adjacent area of scleritis. The edges of the furrow are steeper than the gradual attenuation seen in pellucid marginal degeneration, and there may be a corneal infiltrate adjacent to the area of thinning. Furrow degeneration may have strong association with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nMooren\u2019s ulcer: Mooren\u2019s ulcer, an idiopathic peripheral corneal melting disorder, is characterised by associated severe pain and may be accompanied by an epithelial defect over the area of thinning. It may be accompanied by corneal vascularisation adjacent to the area of thinning in the acute phase. Usually the site of involvement is the inferior limbus, with the ulceration then spreading circumlimbally and then centrally, eventually involving the entire cornea. At the end stages of Mooren\u2019s ulcer, there is vascularisation and scarring of cornea with stromal thinning to less than half of the original corneal thickness.\n\nRheumatologic disorder affecting cornea: Rheumatologic disorder affecting cornea is also a peripheral melting disorder. It is characterised by pain and may be accompanied by an epithelial defect over the area of thinning. It may also be accompanied by corneal vascularisation adjacent to the area of thinning in the acute phase.\n\nContact lens-induced warping of cornea: Contact lens-induced warping of cornea may mimic the appearance of pellucid marginal degeneration on corneal topography.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\nVast majority of patients with PMD are managed by medical therapy.\n\n\tManagement of PMD is dependent on the severity of the disease.\n\nMild stage:\n\n\nSpectacle correction: To begin with in the early mild stages of the disease, spectacle correction is prescribed. Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses.\n\nSoft (hydro gel) toric contact lenses: Soft toric (lenses for astigmatism) contact lenses may be useful in the early mild stages of the condition only, usually before the progression of irregular astigmatism. Hybrid (rigid gas permeable and hydro gel combined) contact lenses viz. Saturn II lenses, SoftPerm lenses and SynergEyes lenses have also been used.\n\n\nModerate stage:\n\n\nRigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for moderate cases of PMD. Large amount of irregular against-the-rule astigmatism results in unstable lens centration and excessive inferior edge stand-off. Therefore, larger-diameter RGP lenses may provide satisfactory lens stability and tolerance with good visual acuity. \u2018Bi-toric\u2019 RGP contact lenses have also been used successfully. Specialised back surface design lenses may correct large amounts of corneal astigmatism and may provide good visual acuity. RGP and soft contact lens with \u2018sector management control\u2019 allow peripheral lens geometry to be customised to complement the anterior surface of the ectatic cornea.\n\n\nAdvanced stage:\n\n\nRigid gas permeable (RGP) scleral contact lenses: In advanced stages, adequate RGP lens centration may be difficult to achieve as additional corneal steepening increases the possibility of lens dislocation with blinking. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) scleral contact lenses have certain advantages.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nAdvantages of scleral contact lenses are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They are supported by the sclera thus reducing lid sensation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They provide good centration, thus high-powered lenses remain static.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They are unlikely to dislodge upon blinking.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They vault the area of the cornea affected by the disease making irregular topography less of a problem to fit.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is less risk of foreign body entrapment.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDisadvantages of scleral contact lenses are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Poor oxygen transfer to cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Difficulties in application as compared to corneal RGP lenses.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Complicated manufacturing processes.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Relatively few practitioners are experienced in fitting such lenses.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy: \n\n\nKeratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with PMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens.\n\n\nPenetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with PMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection, suture-induced complications and corneal neovascularisation. Penetrating keratoplasty also induces large amounts of post-operative astigmatism which may be difficult to correct due to variation in the graft-host thickness.\n\nDeep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue.\n\nLamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea is used. Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty was used earlier to treat PMD.\n\nLamellar thermo- keratoplasty (LTK): Lamellar thermo-keratoplasty (LTK) is an adaptation of lamellar crescentic keratoplasty. This involves thermal shrinkage of the host lamellar bed, prior to the placement and suturing of the crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea.\n\nLamellar crescentic resection (LCR): Lamellar crescentic resection (LCR) involves excision of the abnormally thinned stroma and then re-approximation of the near-normal thickness edges. The major advantage is that no donor tissue is required.\n\nCorneal wedge excision/resection: Corneal wedge excision/resection is similar to lamellar crescentic resection, except that it involves full thickness corneal tissue removal followed by re-apposition of the remaining normal thickness cornea using sutures.\n\nEpikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery used for PMD. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction.\n\n\u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty: \u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.\n\n\nIntra-stromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS): Intrastromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS) helps in reducing the myopia and astigmatism and improving spectacle- corrected visual acuity. Intrastromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS) involves incorporation of two semi-circular plastic rings into the peripheral corneal stroma. In PMD, the ectatic corneal tissue has a thinner structure and is potentially more easily flattened as compared to normal eyes.\n\nCombined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking: Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking consists of photo-polymerisation of corneal stroma by combining vitamin B2 (photosensitising substance) with UVA. This process increases rigidity of corneal collagen and thus reduces the likelihood of further ectasia.\n\nToric phakic intraocular lens (TPIOL): The use of toric phakic intraocular lens (TPIOL) has also been reported.\n\n\n\tPMD patients presenting with acute hydrops or corneal perforation may be treated with glue tissue adhesive, bandage soft contact lenses, crescentic lamellar keratoplasty, penetrating keratoplasty or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPellucid marginal degeneration progresses slowly over the years and may result in severe visual deterioration. Being rare, no large scale longitudinal studies are reported.\n\n\tSince pellucid marginal degeneration affects corneal periphery, contact lens fitting and surgical correction is more difficult as compared to keratoconus.", "complications":"Complications of PMD may be:\n\n\nAcute corneal hydrops: PMD rarely may lead to acute corneal hydrops due to breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane, leading to corneal oedema. During recovery from acute hydrops, corneal vascularisation and scarring may occur.", "Prevention":"The causes of preeclampsia are still unknown, thus effective primary prevention is not possible at this stage. However there are some major risk factors for preeclampsia (such as obesity), and rectification of these factors might result in a decrease in its frequency.\n\n\tMaternal deaths can occur among severe cases, as the progression from mild to severe can be rapid, unexpected, hence emphasis should be on secondary and tertiary prevention including early detection and proper management of preeclampsia.

 {"id":232, "name":"Thermal Injuries to the Eye", "intro":"Presbyopia is the gradual age- related loss of accommodative amplitude which begins early in life and culminates in complete loss of accommodation by about 50 years of age. The word presbyopia is derived from the Greek words presbus (meaning old man) and ops (eye).\n\n\tAccommodation is a dynamic, optical change in the dioptric power of the eye allowing the point of focus of the eye to be changed from distant to near objects. Accommodation is the ability to increase the refractive power of the optical system of eye. It occurs to produce a clear image of near objects. For accommodation, the ciliary body contracts, the lens zonules relax, and the crystalline lens assumes a more spherical shape, which increases its refractive power. Other than presbyopia, disorders that affect accommodation are quite rare. Regardless of the cause, it causes blurred vision for near objects and there is eyestrain with prolonged near work.\n\n\tIn an un-accommodated, emmetropic (with no refractive error) eye, distant objects at or beyond what is considered optical infinity for the eye (6 meters) are focused on the retina. For an object closer to the eye, the eye accommodates for a clearly focused image on the retina. Myopic eyes, being too long for the optical power, are unable to attain a sharply focused image for objects at optical infinity. Myopes can focus clearly on objects closer to the eye than optical infinity without accommodation (i.e. objects at their far point). In contrast, young hypermetropes are only able to focus clearly on objects at optical infinity through an accommodative increase in the optical power, provided their accommodative amplitude exceeds the amount of hypermetropia.\n\nOptical requirements of accommodation: The optical power of the crystalline lens increases (i.e. the focal length of lens decreases) during accommodation. As a result, the eye changes focus from distance to near so that the image of near object focuses on retina. The dioptric change in power of the eye defines accommodation and accommodation is measured in units of dioptres (D). A dioptre is reciprocal of meter and is a measure of the vergence of light. Light rays converging towards a point image are designated to have positive vergence. An object at optical infinity subtends zero vergence at the cornea. Cornea and crystalline lens add positive vergence to bring light towards a focus on the retina. If the eye accommodates from an object at optical infinity to an object 1.0 meters in front of the eye, this represents 1.0 D of accommodation. If the eye accommodates from infinity to 0.5 meters in front of the eye, this is 2 D of accommodation. Thus, the accommodative response is the increase in optical power the eye undergoes, to change focus from an object at optical infinity to the near object.\n\n\tThe accommodative apparatus of the eye consists of ciliary muscle, ciliary body, choroid, anterior and posterior zonular fibers, the lens capsule and the crystalline lens.\n\n\tAlthough presbyopia is age related, the age of onset varies around the world. For example, presbyopia develops earlier in people who live closer to the equator. Specifically, the age of onset of presbyopia is noted to be 37 years in India. Further studies show that the important variable is ambient temperature rather than latitude. Higher the ambient temperature, earlier is the onset of presbyopia.\n\n\tPresbyopia (\u2018old- age sight\u2019) occurs when the near point of accommodation recedes to a point where it is difficult or impossible to accommodate sufficiently for reading or other close work. For most people, close work becomes difficult when the amplitude of accommodation is less than 5 dioptres (corresponding to a near point of accommodation of 20 cm).\n\n\tOnce presbyopia occurs, it gradually increases over a period of 10 to 12 years and then stabilises. A presbyope usually requires a + 1.00 D (dioptres) of reading addition in the age of early forties, levelling off to about + 2.50 D at about the age of 55 years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Ali\u03cc Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K, Agarwal Amar.

Mild myopia (short- sightedness), in contrast, may have delayed onset of symptoms of presbyopia.\n\n\tMost disorders of accommodation are bilateral. Thus, if a patient is corrected to emmetropia, the amount of near blurring should be similar in each eye. Disorders that present as a unilateral loss of accommodation localise to the infra-nuclear third nerve, ciliary ganglion (Adie\u2019s syndrome), effector ciliary body itself (pharmacological cycloplegia or paralysis of accommodation).\n\n\tAccommodative disorders typically present with symptoms of:\n\n\n\t\tBlurring of vision for near in both eyes.\n\n\t\tEyestrain.\n\n\t\tHeadache after prolonged focus.\n\n\t\tStinging.\n\n\t\tWatering.\n\n\t\tIncrease in comfortable reading distance.\n\n\t\tTrouble in focusing when tired.\n\n\t\tSlow response to change in focus distance.\n\n\t\tRunning of letters and lines.\n\n\n\tThese symptoms are intensified under inadequate light conditions, poor contrast and are exaggerated at the end of the day.", "causes":"Presbyopia is caused due to loss of the fine balance of forces that permit the accommodative structures to bring a change in optical power of the lens in the young eye.\n\n\tWith advancing age, there is decline in the ability of the eye to accommodate or change its focus.\n\nNeural pathway for accommodation:\n\n\tAccommodation is associated with convergence and miosis forming the triad of \u2018near reflex\u2019.\n\n\tThe neural pathway for accommodation probably originates in the caudal part of the Edinger- Westphal or third nerve parasympathetic nucleus in the midbrain. These areas receive input from the cerebral cortex and pretectum. Fibers from the third nerve nucleus, responsible for accommodation, then travel to the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers going to ciliary body and iris sphincter. Then via short ciliary nerves, they reach to the intrinsic muscles of the eye.\n\tParasympathetic control is of much greater clinical importance. However, experiments have shown that the ciliary body receives sympathetic input as well. Since accommodation is mediated almost exclusively via parasympathetic pathways, it is antagonised best with muscarinic receptor (type of acetylcholine receptors) blockers. With muscarinic antagonists, paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) is always associated with dilatation of pupil (mydriasis).\n\n\tMuscarinic antagonists commonly used are:\n\n\nTropicamide: Tropicamide has a very short half- life and should not be used to conduct cycloplegic refraction.\n\nCyclopentolate: Cyclopentolate has sufficient half- life and may be used for cycloplegic refraction, even in children.\n\nHomatropine.\n\nScopolamine (hyoscine). \n\nAtropine.\n\n\n\tHomatropine, scopolamine (hyoscine) and atropine are generally used for therapeutic (treatment) purposes.\n\n\tThere is great variability in the normal levels of accommodation. Accommodative ability decreases with age. Children have great accommodative capabilities and presbyopia is rare before thirty five years of age.\n\nMechanism of accommodation:\n\nHelmholtz in 1855 provided the description of accommodative mechanism. When the young eye is un-accommodated and focused for distance, the ciliary muscle is relaxed. Resting tension on anterior zonular fibers inserting around the lens equator, apply an outward directed tension to hold the lens in a relatively flattened and un-accommodated state. For near focus, the ciliary muscle contracts, the inner apex of the ciliary body moves forward and towards the axis of the eye. This stretches the posterior attachment of the ciliary muscle and releases resting tension on all zonular fibers around the lens equator. The lens capsule then moulds and provides the force to cause the lens to become accommodated. The accommodative increase in optical power of the lens comes about from an increase in the lens anterior surface curvature, and to lesser extent, of the posterior surface curvatures.\n\n\tWhen accommodative effort is over, the ciliary muscle relaxes and the elasticity of the posterior attachment of the choroid pulls the ciliary muscle back into its flattened and un-accommodated state. The outward movement of the apex of the ciliary body once again increases the tension on the anterior zonular fibers around the lens equator to pull the lens via the capsule into a flattened and un-accommodated form.\n\nAlternative theory of mechanism of accommodation:\n\nSchachar (1993) proposed that zonular tension is increased during accommodation in young subjects in contrast with the classic Helmholtz\u2019s theory. The basic assumptions are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During near accommodation, the lens equator moves outward causing an increase in lens diameter.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The equatorial lens diameter increases with age due to natural growth of the lens.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presbyopia is caused by decrease of the distance between lens equator and ciliary muscle leaving not enough space for the lens equator to move outward with accommodation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOcular changes resulting in presbyopia:\n\n\tChanges that occur in the eye resulting in presbyopia are broadly divided into three categories:\n\n\nLens and lens capsule- based theories: Lens and lens capsule- based theories consider changes in the elasticity and compliance of the lens and its capsule. There is continued deposition of the lens fibers within the lens as it ages, causing the lens to become compact and stiff. A major factor in the loss of accommodation may be the increased stiffness of the ageing lens with inability to respond to accommodative stimuli. The near point of accommodation gradually recedes from about 7 cm at the age of 10 years to about 20 cm at the age of 40 years and it recedes further to about 40 cm at about the age of 50 years.\n\nExtralenticular theories: Extralenticular theories consider changes in the ciliary muscle and choroid.\n\nGeometric theories: Geometric theories consider changes in the geometry of the zonular attachments to the lens.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOther causes of diminished near vision are:\n\n\n\t\tUncorrected hypermetropia where all the accommodation is used for clear distant vision.\n\n\t\tUse of local or systemic parasympatholytic drugs (e.g.atropine).\n\n\t\tAphakia and pseudo-phakia.\n\n\t\tInternal ophthalmoplegia.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosing presbyopia is straightforward and age of the patient is a major consideration. A simple reading test using well- illuminated text of graded sizes at a standard distance may be helpful both in characterising the degree of near- vision and in determining the appropriate refractive power.\n\n\tAccommodation may be measured by determining the accommodative amplitude or the accommodative range.\n\n\tMonocular accommodative amplitude may be measured by following methods:\n\n\nSubjective push- up method: Subjective push- up method involves a small target (like near letter chart) being brought forward toward the eye until it blurs. It is the near point of accommodation. The reciprocal of the distance at which the target blurs is the accommodative amplitude in dioptres.\n\nPrince rule: Prince rule combines a scaled ruler with a near addition of + 3 D (dioptres), and it puts the far point of an emmetrope (a person with no refractive error) at 33 cm. The target on Prince rule is brought forward until it blurs. Taking account of addition of + 3, this distance is converted into dioptres of accommodative amplitude.\n\nNegative powered trial lenses: The test uses a distance letter chart and lenses of increasing minus spherical power to induce accommodation. More minus sphere is added until the subject can no longer overcome the minus lenses with accommodation. The amount of minus sphere that can be overcome represents the accommodative amplitude.\n\n\n\tAccurate objective measurements of accommodation may be done statically or dynamically with auto-refractors, refractometers or aberrometers. Dynamic optometers provide a real-time graphic display of the accommodative response and can provide an indication of how much the accommodative response varies over time. Objective methods provide a true measure of accommodative amplitude of the eye.\n\n\tAccommodation may also be stimulated by topically applied muscarinic agonists (e.g. pilocarpine) and the resulting accommodative response measured periodically over 30- 45 minutes using a refractometer or an auto-refractor until the maximal accommodative response is attained.\n\n\tAssessment of accommodative range:\n\n\nAccommodative range: Accommodative range refers to the range of distances which can be viewed clearly by using accommodation. It is expressed without correction for emmetropia. A + 2 hypermetrope with 4 D of accommodation would have an uncorrected accommodative range from infinity to 50 cm. A minus 2 myope with similar accommodative amplitude would have an accommodative range from 50 cm to about 17 cm.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\n\tPresbyopia is the most common cause of accommodative dysfunction.\n\n\tPresbyopia should be differentiated from other conditions with decreased accommodation like:\n\n\nTrauma along neuro-anatomical pathway: Trauma to the parasympathetic nuclei in the midbrain, to supra-nuclear structures, or to the third nerve may produce symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain).\n\nAdie\u2019s syndrome: Adie\u2019s syndrome is characterised by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light (tonic pupil), along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon. Adie\u2019s syndrome is usually associated with decrease in accommodation.\n\nPharmacological cycloplegia: Pharmacological cycloplegia also produces temporary accommodative dysfunction.\n\nSystemic medications: Systemic medications may cause decrease in accommodation. These medicines often have anti-cholinergic side effects. Examples include phenothiazines and anti-parkinsonian drugs.\n\n\nUnlike presbyopia, increased accommodation is rarely seen as in:\n\n\nHorner Syndrome: Several experiments have shown that ciliary body also receives sympathetic input. This is shown clinically by the increased accommodative amplitude seen in the affected eye of patients with Horner Syndrome.\n\nMiotic agents: Miotic agents such as pilocarpine may cause an abnormally proximal near point.\n\nAccommodative spasm: Accommodative spasm is a functional disorder characterised by blurred vision for distance, diplopia, episodic esotropia (inward turning of eye), miosis (small pupil), and an abnormal near point of accommodation.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tIt is important to correct refractive error properly to put the far point at infinity so that ocular system is emmetropic for distance.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tManagement of presbyopia involves use of plus lenses for near work either in a bifocal or as reading glasses only. Most problems with reading addition of plus glasses result from over- correction for the near distance.\n\n\tCorrection to emmetropia and the use of trial frames to determine the proper power give good results.\n\n\nSpectacle correction: Reading glasses, bifocals, progressive glasses, and even trifocals, are the most common methods of correction for eyes that can no longer focus on near objects, and are the most versatile option.\n\nContact lenses: Different contact lenses are available for the presbyopes. These are either bifocal or multifocal contact lenses, but these have received a mixed response by the users. An additional alternative is mono-vision contact lenses, where the refractive power of one eye is set for focus at a distance and the other eye for focusing near objects. Although image is clear for each eye, there is concomitant loss of depth perception. A general drawback to the use of contact lens for presbyopia is the decrease in tear production with ageing.\n\n\nSurgical refractive presbyopia management:\n\n\tNatural accommodation has both accommodative and pseudo-accommodative components. Accommodation (i.e. real change in optical power) should be distinguished from the ability to see clearly for near. Depth of focus bifocality or multifocality (e.g. multifocal intraocular lens) may provide a variable degree of functional near vision. Such vision is known as pseudo-accommodation.\n\n\tTreatment may be performed by replacing the crystalline lens with a multifocal lens after cataract surgery. If the crystalline lens is still clear, it may be preferable to treat presbyopia in a way that allows for preserving lens.\n\nI. Pseudo-accommodative procedures:\n\n\nMono-vision: Mono-vision refers to correcting dominant one eye to emmetropia and the other to myopia between minus 1 and minus 2 D, which can be achieved by excimer laser surgery. In hypermetropia, a steepening of the cornea with overcorrection of one eye may be performed by laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK). The limitation of mono-vision is the lack of a possibility for correction of intermediate distance vision without simultaneously affecting near and distance vision.\n\nMultifocal excimer laser: Multifocal corneal ablation with laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is currently used almost exclusively in hypermetropic and emmetropic eyes.\n\nIntra-corneal implants: Exact control of the lamellar corneal cut is obtained with microkeratome and femtosecond laser technologies. Benefit of these intra-corneal implants is their reversibility. If the implant is not well tolerated, or cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is to be performed later, it can be removed, thereby restoring the original shape of the cornea.\n\nMultifocal intraocular (IOL) lenses: \n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refractive multifocal IOLs: Refractive bifocal or multifocal IOLs have on their optic two or more ring- shaped spherical zones of different refraction. The near part is usually located in the center of the lens optic. With accommodative miosis, the near part comes into play when looking at near targets, and the distance part when looking at far points. Efficacy of this depends on the centration of the IOL and diameter of the pupil.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diffractive multifocal IOLs: Diffractive multifocal IOLs part away the light to two focus points, one for near and one for distance. They have a diffractive anterior or posterior surface with concentric rings for the diffraction of incoming light rays, which are focused onto a far and a near point. The bifocality is largely independent of pupil diameter and centration.\n\n\tSome modern multifocal IOLs use a combination of refractive and diffractive principles.\n\nII. Accommodative procedures:\n\n\nAnterior ciliary sclerotomy and sclera expansion: Anterior ciliary sclerotomy and sclera expansion procedure is based on alternative theory of the mechanism of accommodation, proposed by Schachar. Accordingly, it seems logical to increase this space for the lens equator to move outward.\n\nPotentially accommodating IOLs: Accommodating IOLs are designed to transform the movement of the ciliary muscle into a dynamic change of ocular dioptric power. Accommodative IOLs are based on the principle of optic shift. Haptic (which hold the lens in place) contraction of the ciliary muscle is supposed to shift the IOL optic anteriorly. This allows for only small accommodative amplitude.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tMost patients with symptoms of eye strain do well with plus power glasses for reading. Plus power requirements increase until patients attain the age of early sixties, and then stabilise.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

 {"id":234, "name":"Taeniasis/cysticercosis", "intro":"Pseudophakia refers to the presence of an intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The IOL may be inserted at the time of cataract surgery for the removal of crystalline lens or it may be put as a secondary procedure to correct aphakia. The IOL may be placed in the anterior chamber (anterior-chamber IOL) or posterior chamber (posterior-chamber IOL).\n\n\tRefractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the crystalline lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.\n\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\n\n\tThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.\n\n\tPrevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers.\n\n\tIOLs are made up of acrylic or quality Perspex i.e. poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). The lenses are about 4- 6 mm in diameter and are biconvex or plano- convex. Lens power calculations for primary implantation necessitate axial length measurement with ultrasonography, keratometry and the use of standard tables. A stronger lens may be required in children. Lens loops are usually made up of flexible methyl-methacrylate. Foldable IOLs made up of silicone or various polymers of acrylic are also available for insertion through a small incision following cataract surgery by phacoemulsification.\n\n\tA patient who needs 12.5 D in aphakic spectacles would need about 21 D of an IOL in posterior chamber of eye. The average magnification of an IOL in posterior chamber is about 1.5%, compared with the original crystalline lens. For an anterior chamber IOL the average power is about 18 D, and the magnification is about 2 %. Some patients may detect this disparity by alternately covering each eye. Almost everyone can achieve binocular vision with one eye pseudophakia and other phakic (eye with crystalline lens). An IOL may be implanted at the time of cataract surgery or as secondary implantation at a later date.

Majority of implanted lenses are biconvex. In addition to minimising the effects of tilt, decentration and spherical aberration, a convex posterior surface of a biconvex lens may reduce the migration of lens epithelial cells which produces opacification of the posterior capsule. Positive meniscus lens is rarely used because when it is tilted or decentered, the induced astigmatism and power change is dramatic. A 10\u02da- 15\u02da tilt can induce enough regular and irregular astigmatism to make the spectacle correction intolerable.\n\nEdge design: Reflections, flashes and shimmering peripheral lights are related to the edge design. Most lenses had rounded edges to avoid reflected images.\n\nOptical transmission: After removal of crystalline lens, light with wavelengths of 300- 400 nm reaches to the retina. Ultraviolet light filtration is done in almost all IOLs to reduce blue light hazard to the eye.\n\nMaterial: IOLs are mainly made up of PMMA, silicone or acrylic. Silicone and acrylic lenses are foldable so that they can be implanted through small incisions (2.2 to 3.5 mm in length). Higher the refractive index, flatter is the curvatures of lens. Due to flatter curvature, acrylic lens is the thinnest of all.\n\nSpecial lenses: There are three special types of IOL viz. Multifocal, toric and aspheric.\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Multifocal IOLs produce an image that is about 30% reduced in contrast to mono-focal lenses.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toric IOL lenses are spherocylindrical glasses similar to spectacles. The magnitude of the cylinder in the IOL should be about 1.4 times the astigmatism in the cornea to neutralise corneal astigmatism completely.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aspheric IOL lenses are designed to minimise spherical aberration and to restore asphericity of eyes in young patients.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nCalculation of IOL power: \n\n\tPrior to cataract surgery, the power of the IOL needed to give desired postoperative refraction is determined by measuring corneal curvature and axial length in a mathematical formula.\n\n\tCorneal curvature is measured commonly by keratometry. Small variability of the keratometry reading gives an IOL power to within 0.5 D. Variability in the measurement of the axial length tends to be the main source of discrepancy in the calculation of IOL power.\n\n\tWhen the cornea is irregular (due to corneal pathology or previous corneal or refractive procedures), a better prediction of the required IOL power may be obtained using corneal topography (photokeratoscopy or videokeratography) rather than keratometry to measure the corneal curvature. Corneal topography generates many more data points to be used in calculation of IOL power. Corneal topography may be used to assess the magnitude, location and regularity of pre- existing astigmatism. Incision in the peripheral part of steep axis produces a central flattening effect and reduces astigmatism. Change in corneal contour is less for the more peripheral incisions in the sclera or limbus.\n\nIOL calculations that require axial length:\n\nTheoretical formulas: These formulas for IOL power calculation has not changed since its original description by Fyoderov et al. in 1967. Several investigators have presented these formulas in different forms. Six variables used in the formula are\n\n\n\t\tNet corneal power.\n\n\t\tAxial length.\n\n\t\tIOL power.\n\n\t\tEffective lens position.\n\n\t\tDesired refraction.\n\n\t\tVertex distance.\n\n\n\tSeveral additional measurements of the eye are taken, but only seven preoperative variables (axial length, corneal power, horizontal corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, preoperative refraction, and age) were found to improve significantly the prediction of effective lens position. Third generation formulas Holladay 1, Hoffer Q and SRK/T and newer Holladay 2 are much more accurate than previous formulas. Older formulas such as SRK1, SRK2, and Binkhorst 1do not give desired result if the central corneal power is measured incorrectly.\n\nRefractive lens exchange (RLE) for high myopia and hypermetropia with normal cornea and no previous keratorefractive surgery: \n\n\tSince there is loss of accommodation and the patients are relatively young, a small degree of myopia (minus 0.50 D) may be desirable so that dependence on spectacles may be reduced.\n\n\tFor myopia, third- generation theoretical formulas give excellent predictions if the axial length is stable and the measurements are accurate.\n\n\tFor hypermetrpia, the Holladay 2 formula is used. The use of this formula may reduce the prediction error in these cases to less than 1 D. Accurate measurements of axial length and corneal power are especially important in these cases.\n\nMethods to determine axial length: Axial length may be determined by optical methods and ultrasonic methods. Ultrasonic measurement is less dependent on the density of the cataract.\n\nPatients with previous keratorefractive surgery:\n\n\tThe number of patients who had keratorefractive surgery (radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy, or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis) is increasing steadily. These groups of patients present a difficult challenge. Instruments used to measure corneal power make incorrect assumptions for corneas that have irregular astigmatism. Due to this, the calculation method and the trial hard contact lens method are the most accurate, followed by corneal topography, automated keratometry, and manual keratometry.\n\n\nCalculation method: For this, three parameters must be known viz. Net corneal power, refraction status before keratorefractive procedure, and the stabilised refraction after the keratorefractive procedure. This method usually is most accurate because the preoperative net corneal power values and refraction usually are accurate to \u00b1 0.25 D.\n\nTrial hard contact lens method: The trial hard contact lens method requires a plano hard contact lens with a known base curve and a patient whose cataract does not prevent refraction to about \u00b1 0.50 D. The spheroequivalent refraction is calculated by normal refraction. The refraction is then repeated with hard contact lens. If the spheroequivalent refraction does not change with contact lens, then the power value for cornea of the patient must be same as that of the base curve of the plano contact lens in place.\n\nCorneal topography: Corneal topography measure more than 5000 points over the entire cornea and more than 1000 points within the central 3 mm of cornea. This allows a very accurate determination of the anterior surface of the cornea. However, it does not provide any information about the posterior surface of the cornea. Most IOL calculations use a net index of refraction (1.3333) and the anterior radius of the cornea to calculate the net power of the cornea. Topography provides an excellent overview of central and peripheral corneal shape. Corneal topography does not provide accurate corneal power following keratorefractive surgery (radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy, or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis) with optical zones of 3 mm or less. In radial keratotomy with larger optical zones, the topography becomes more reliable. Calculation method and hard contact lens trial method are always more reliable.\n\nAutomated keratometry: Automated keratometers usually are more accurate than manual keratometers for corneas of small optical zone of about 3 mm for radial keratotomy. Automated keratometry measurements following photorefractive keratectomy or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis, yield better values of the front radius of the cornea. Like corneal topography, measurements are still not accurate.\n\nManual keratometry: Manual keratometers provide the least accurate measure of central corneal power following keratorefractive surgery, because the area that they measure usually is larger than 3.2 mm in diameter. Thus, measurements in this area are extremely unreliable for radial keratotomy corneas that have optical zones less than or equal to 4mm.The manual keratometer has similar problem with photorefractive keratectomy or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis as with topography or automated keratometers and, thus, is less accurate.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nIOL calculations using net corneal power values and preoperative refraction: \n\n\tIn a standard cataract surgery with IOL implantation, the preoperative refraction is not very helpful for calculation of the power of an implant, because as the crystalline lens is removed, so the diopteric power is being removed and then replaced. Cases in which power is not reduced in the eye (such as secondary implant in aphakia, piggy-back IOL in pseudophakia, or a minus IOL in the anterior chamber of a myopic phakic eye), the necessary IOL power for a desired postoperative refraction may be calculated from the corneal power and pre- operative refraction. Measurement of axial length is not necessary.\n\n\tThe formula used for calculation of IOL power uses following variables\n\n\n\t\tExpected lens position in millimetres (distance from corneal vertex to principal plane of IOL).\n\n\t\tIOL power in dioptres.\n\n\t\tNet corneal power in dioptres.\n\n\t\tPreoperative refraction in dioptres.\n\n\t\tDesired postoperative refraction in dioptres.\n\n\t\tVertex distance in millimetres of refraction.\n\n\nSecondary piggy-back IOL in pseudophakia: \n\n\tIn patients who have significant residual refractive error following primary IOL implant, it is often easier surgically and more predictable optically, to leave the primary implant in place and calculate the secondary piggy-back IOL power to achieve the desired refraction. This method does not require knowledge of the power of the primary implant or of the axial length. This formula works for both plus or minus lenses.\n\nPrimary minus IOL in the anterior chamber of a myopic phakic eye:\n\n\tThe calculation for a minus IOL in the anterior chamber is the same as for the aphakic calculation of an anterior chamber lens, with the exception that the power of the lens is negative. In the past, these lenses were reserved for high myopia that could not be corrected by radial keratotomy or photorefractive keratectomy. Because successful laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis procedures have been performed in myopias up to minus 20 D, these lenses may be reserved for myopia that exceeds this power.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOptical refractive state in pseudophakia:\n\n\tIt depends upon the power of the Implanted IOL. Postoperatively, patient may have\n\n\nEmmetropia: Emmetropia or normal refractive state is produced when the power of IOL matches with the refractive state of the eye. This is the most sought after ideal situation. Patients need correction only for reading or near vision.\n\nConsecutive myopia: This is produced when the implanted IOL overcorrects the refraction of the eye. Such patients require correction with glasses for correction of myopia for distance vision and may or may not require glasses for reading or near vision, depending upon the degree of myopia.\n\nConsecutive hypermetropia: This condition is produced when the IOL implanted has power less than the refractive state of the eye. Such patients require correction with convex glasses for distance and an additional plus correction for reading or near vision.\n\nAstigmatism: Surgically induced astigmatism of varying degree may also be present in pseudophakia.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis depends upon\n\nHistory: It documents whether previous cataract surgery was performed, and whether were there any associated complications or not.\n\nExamination of eyes: Eyes are examined for\n\n\n\t\tAssessment of visual acuity.\n\n\t\tTonometry to measure intraocular pressure.\n\n\t\tCorneal examination for any oedema.\n\n\t\tGonioscopy to assess angle of the anterior chamber.\n\n\t\tAnterior chamber for cells, flare or presence of vitreous.\n\n\t\tIris for any iridectomy or iritis.\n\n\t\tPosition and stability of IOL.\n\n\t\tIntegrity and clarity of posterior capsule.\n\n\t\tOphthalmoscopy to rule out any cystoid macular oedema.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSigns:\n\n\n\t\tVisible surgical wound in the cornea or sclera near the limbus.\n\n\t\tAnterior chamber is of normal depth or only slightly deeper than normal.\n\n\t\tIridodonesis (tremulousness) of iris is usually not there.\n\n\t\tThere are four Purkinje images.

The deviation is more noticeable when the child turns head and the eyes are in lateral gaze, especially in pseudoesotropia because nasal sclera appears buried in the epicanthal fold.\n\n\tParents may bring pictures of the baby with eyes in pseudoeso- or pseudoexodeviation.", "causes":"I. Pseudoesotropia: Pseudoesotropia is the most common type of pseudostrabismus and may be seen due to\n\n\nMorphological features: Morphological features such as orientation, shape and size of the orbits, shape and size of globes, and volume of retro-bulbar tissue may create an impression of misaligned eyes. Commonly this is seen in infants who have wide nasal bridge with prominent epicanthal folds (semi-lunar folds of skin near medial canthus).\n\nInterpupillary distance (IPD): Patients with small interpupillary distance (IPD) may also appear to be esotropic.\n\nNegative angle kappa: A negative angle kappa (angle formed between visual axis and pupillary axis at the pupil), where corneal light reflex appears to be on the temporal side of the center of pupil, may simulate esodeviation.\n\nEnophthalmos: Enophthalmos gives the appearance of convergent deviation.\n\n\nII. Pseudoexotropia: Pseudoexotropia may result due to\n\n\nMorphological features: Morphological features of the face may result in false appearance of eyes to be divergent. Most commonly hypertelorism (widely set eyes) may result in pseudoexotropia.\n\nInterpupillary distance (IPD): Patients with wide interpupillary distance (IPD) give the appearance of divergent deviation.\n\nPositive angle kappa: Pathologic ectopia of the macula temporally due to traction of retina may produce a positive angle kappa. Positive angle kappa results in nasal displacement of the light reflex on the cornea simulating exotropia. Pseudoexotropia due to positive angle kappa is mostly seen in retinopathy of prematurity, which results in temporal dragging of the macula. It may also be seen in ectopic macula resulting from high myopia, toxocara retinal scars or congenital retinal folds.\n\nExophthalmos: Exophthalmos gives the appearance of divergent deviation.\n\n\nIII. Pseudohypertropia: Pseudohypertropia may be due to\n\n\nFacial asymmetry: Facial asymmetry which produces an appearance of vertically misaligned eyes where one eye appears to be higher than the other.\n\nOrbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours of the orbital floor may produce hypoglobus (downward displacement of eyeball) simulating vertical misalignment.\n\nTrauma: Trauma to the orbital floor may also produce hypoglobus simulating vertical misalignment.\n\n\nIV. Miscellaneous causes:\n\n\nPtosis may give appearance of vertical deviation.\n\nFacial asymmetry.\n\nPalpebral fissure asymmetry.\n\nDermatochalasis (lax eyelid skin and muscle).\n\nAbnormal head posture.\n\nIll-fitting spectacles.\n\nHeterochromia iridis (a difference in colour of iris of an eye).\n\nColoboma of iris (a fissure or gap in the iris).\n\nAnisocoria (a difference in size of the pupils).\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nPrematurity: Prematurity may cause retinopathy of prematurity which may result in temporal dragging of macula producing positive angle kappa and pseudoexotropia.\n\nFacial morphology: Prominent epicanthal folds in asian children results in pseudoesotropia.\n\nOrbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours may result in pseudohypertropia.\n\nOrbital trauma: It may produce hypoglobus resulting in pseudohypertropia in some patients.\n\nChorioretinal infections: These may produce chorioretinal scarring with temporal dragging of macula resulting in pseudoexotropia.", "diagnosis":"Clinical diagnosis of pseudostrabismus requires ruling out the presence of true intermittent or constant strabismus.\n\n\tPatients with pseudostrabismus require full investigation as the prevalence of strabismus is higher in those diagnosed with pseudostrabismus.\n\n\tDiagnosis depends upon clinical history, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests.\n\n\tDetailed history regarding weight at birth, gestational age, health of child, any procedure for retinopathy of prematurity may give diagnostic clues. History of initial presentation aided by photographs of the child may assist in documenting the onset, detecting the stability of the condition and confirming the diagnosis.\n\n\tA good physical examination comprises of inspection of eye and adnexal morphology.\n\n\tBoth normal and pathologic variations in palpebral fissure may produce the appearance of strabismus, despite normal alignment of the visual axis of two eyes. Diagnosis of pseudoesotropia in infants with large epicanthal folds is probably the most common reason. Family members may believe that strabismus is present because they do not see much of white sclera on the nasal aspect of the eye compared to the temporal aspect. After careful examination, most parents may often be convinced that the position and shape of the eyelids and ocular adnexal structures may produce the appearance of strabismus. Doubting parents may be convinced by tightening the epicanthal fold by pinching the bridge of the nose.\n\n\tSimilarly, abnormalities involving the lateral canthal area may create impression of exotropia.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDiagnostic tests\n\nI. Visual acuity evaluation: Every patient presenting with pseudostrabismus should have complete evaluation of visual acuity.\n\nII. Motor evaluation: It comprises of tests such as\n\n\nHirschberg\u2019s light reflex test: This gives a rough objective estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus and is especially useful when fixation in the deviating eye is poor.\n\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A pen-torch is shown in to the eyes from a distance of about one arm and the patient is asked to fixate the light. The corneal reflection of the light is more or less in the center of pupil of the fixating eye, but will be decentered in the squinting eye, in the direction opposite to that of deviation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The distance of the corneal light reflection, if any, is noted. In orthotropic eyes (eyes without squint), there is no decentering of the light reflex.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nCover-uncover test:\n\n\nCover test: This is done to detect heterotropia. It is good to begin the near test first by using light and then the accommodative target. Then the test is done for distance as follows\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The patient fixates a straight-ahead target.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If a right deviation is suspected, the examiner covers the fixing left eye and notes any movement of the right eye to take up fixation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No movement indicates orthotropia or left heterotropia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Adduction of the right eye to take up fixation indicates right exotropia and abduction indicates right esotropia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vertical movement indicates vertical hyper- or hypotropia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The test is repeated in the opposite eye.\n\nUncover test: It detects heterophoria. It is performed both for near and far.\n\n\tMost examiners perform cover and uncover test sequentially, hence the term cover-uncover test.\n\n\nAlternate cover test: It is a dissociation test which reveals the total deviation when fusion is suspended. It is performed after the cover-uncover test. The occluder is shifted quickly back and forth from one eye to other, several times. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery is noted as the eyes return to their pre- dissociated state. A patient with well compensated heterophoria will have straight eyes before and after the test has been performed, whereas a patient with poor control may decompensate to manifest deviation.\n\nOcular movements: It is necessary to test the function of each extra-ocular muscle by testing uniocular and binocular movements.\n\n\nIII. Sensory evaluation: Complete sensory evaluation may give clue to sensory development. Detection of fixation preference for one eye may be performed by vertical prism test.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential diagnosis\n\n\tTrue strabismus should be ruled out by conducting thorough examination before reaching to the conclusion of pseudostrabismus.\n\n\tPatient should be followed-up with re-evaluation every 6 months because true strabismus may sometimes develop in patients with pseudostrabismus.\n\n\tFactors causing pseudostrabismus may be present when there is a true strabismus and may mask or accentuate its presence. Doubtful cases should be followed up. Certain findings are strong indicators that a child should be observed even though no convincing evidence of strabismus is found. These include\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Family history of strabismus or refractive error.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presence of significant heterophoria. Even a small esophoria when present is significant.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A tendency to squeeze eye in sunlight indicates a possible intermittent childhood exotropia.\n\n\tOnce a pseudostrabismus is diagnosed, the parents should be explained the reason for the apparent deviation and reassured.", "management":"Orthoptic investigation establishes the presence of binocular single vision and fusion control in cases of pseudostrabismus.\n\n\tFor the common pseudoesotropia, since the nasal sclera part is being covered by the epicanthus, the orthotropic appearance may be demonstrated by pinching the nasal bridge slightly and revealing the nasal sclera. As the flat nasal bridge develops, this excessive epicanthal skin is raised and the condition corrects by itself. Hence, no treatment is required except for follow-up for disappearance of pseudoesotropia.\n\n\tHowever, true manifest squint is treated if it is associated with pseudostrabismus.\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis\n\n\tThe natural course of pseudostrabismus is variable. Most of the cases of pseudoesotropia resolve usually by the age of two to three years, because the epicanthal folds diminish as the bridge of the nose enlarges.\n\n\tPseudostrabismus secondary to positive or negative angle kappa typically persists in adulthood.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

 {"id":237, "name":"Trochlear Nerve Palsy", "intro":"Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication of delivery and the most common cause of maternal death, accounting for about 35% of all maternal deaths worldwide. These deaths have a major impact on the lives and health of the families affected.\n\n\tPPH is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours after birth, while severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1000 ml or more within the same timeframe according to World Health Organisation (WHO). A small blood loss that makes the woman haemodynamically unstable is also termed as PPH.\n\n\tPPH is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with in the first 24 hours following delivery and this is regarded as primary PPH; whereas any excessive bleeding from the birth canal occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally (after delivery) is termed as secondary PPH.\n\n\tIn practice, blood loss after delivery is seldom measured and it is not clear whether measuring blood loss improves the care and outcome for the women. In addition, some women may require interventions to manage PPH with less blood loss than others if they are anaemic.\n\n\tPPH may result from failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders. Uterine atony is the most common cause and consequently the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.\n\n\tThe maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in 2015 is 239 per 100\u00a0000 live births versus 12 per 100\u00a0000 live births in developed countries. Thus 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries with more than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third occur in South Asia. \u00a0Very small proportion, 1% of maternal deaths occur in the developed world. There are large disparities between countries, but also within countries; maternal deaths are more in low income group and rural areas as compare to high income group and urban areas.\n\n\tAbout 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications around the world every day. 52% of maternal deaths are attributable to three leading preventable causes-haemorrhage, sepsis, and hypertensive disorders. WHO statistics suggest that 25% of maternal deaths are due to PPH. Postpartum bleeding is the quickest of maternal killers; can kill even a healthy woman within two hours, if not treated.\u00a0\n\n\tIncidence of PPH is reported as 2% - 4% after vaginal delivery and 6% after cesarean section; with uterine atony being the cause in about 50% cases. Every year about 14 million women around the world suffer from PPH.\n\n\tIn India sample registration scheme (SRS), during survey of causes of death 1998, reported that PPH was a major cause of maternal mortality and responsible for 30 % of maternal deaths and according to SRS 2001-2003, PPH accounts 38 percent of maternal deaths. Estimates of maternal mortality ratio in India done by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 2003 also showed PPH as a leading cause of maternal mortality in study population. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tA combination of quality antenatal care, skilled care at birth by active management of third stage of labour, the availability of high quality emergency obstetric care (with trained medical personnel and adequate infrastructure) and improved access to these services are essential to save many maternal lives.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/MPSProgressReport\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/\n\nwww.who.int/medicines/areas/priority_medicines/Ch6_\n\nemedicine.medscape.com/article/275038-overview#a5\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3688110/\n\nplanningcommission.nic.in/aboutus/committee/strgrp/stgp_\n\nwww.icmr.nic.in/final/Final%20Pilot%20Report.pdf\n\nfile.scirp.org/pdf/OJOG_2015092116115550.pdf\n\nwww.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/TheLancetChildHealthMaternalHealth.pdf\n\nwww.who.int/pmnch/media/events/2015/gs_2016_30.pdf\n\nnrhm.gov.in/images/pdf/programmes/maternal-health/guidelines/", "symtoms":"The usual presentation of PPH is one of heavy vaginal bleeding that can quickly lead to signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock.\n\n\n\t\tBlood loss is usually visible at the introitus, and this is especially seen when the placenta has delivered.

Atonic bleeding occurs from the placental site when the uterus (myometrial muscles) does not contract and retract properly and thus the blood vessels are not compressed and bleeding is not controlled.\n\n\n\t\tAny condition that interferes with uterine contraction, such as a retained placenta, remnants of placental tissue, membranes and blood clot will predispose to atonic bleeding. Full bladder, antepartum haemorrhage due to placenta praevia (low lying attachment of placenta) or placental abruption (separation of placenta from uterus prior to delivery) may also cause PPH.\n\n\t\tOverstretched uterus as seen in high parity, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios (Increased amount of amniotic fluid), large baby, fibroids may be the risk factors for atonic PPH.\n\n\t\tPoor myometrial contraction can result from fatigue due to prolonged labor or rapid forceful labor, especially if stimulated. It can also result from the inhibition of contractions by drugs (such as halogenated anesthetic agents, nitrates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium sulfate, beta-sympathomimetics, and nifedipine). Anaemia is also a risk factor for PPH.\u00a0\n\n\t\tIntrauterine death with fetus retained in uterus for three to four weeks, severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia may also lead to PPH.\n\n\n\tb) Genital trauma: Damage to the genital tract may occur spontaneously or through manipulations used to deliver the baby. Injuries during labour to perineum, vaginal walls, cervix, uterus, episiotomy, caesarean section can also cause PPH. Trauma may occur following very prolonged or vigorous labor, especially if the patient has relative or absolute cephalopelvic disproportion and the uterus has been stimulated with medicines (oxytocin or prostaglandins). Cervical laceration is most commonly associated with forceps delivery. Trauma also may occur following extrauterine or intrauterine manipulation of the fetus.\n\n\tUterine rupture is most common in patients with previous cesarean delivery scars.\u00a0Any uterus that has undergone a procedure resulting in a total or thick or partial disruption of the uterine wall should be considered at risk for rupture in a future pregnancy.\n\nc) Tissue: Uterine contraction and retraction leads to detachment and expulsion of the placenta. Complete detachment and expulsion of the placenta permits continued retraction and optimal occlusion of blood vessels.\n\n\tRetention of a portion of the placenta and membranes, failure of complete separation of the placenta (placenta accrete) and its variants, placenta previa may cause PPH. The placenta is more likely to be retained at extreme preterm gestations (especially < 24 week) and significant bleeding can occur.\n\nd)Coagulation problems: Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH. Abnormalities related to bleeding disorder (clotting system) may be preexistent or acquired; such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) may be related to preexisting disease called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or acquired secondary to HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count)- a complication of preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and sepsis.\u00a0\n\n\tAn underlying bleeding disorder should be considered in a woman with any of the following: menorrhagia since menarche, family history of bleeding disorders, personal history of notable bruising without known injury, bleeding from the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract without obvious lesion, or epistaxis (nosebleed) of longer than 10 minutes duration (possibly requiring packing or cautery).\n\n\tMost cases of PPH have no identifiable risk factors. PPH usually has a single cause, but more than one cause is also possible.\n\nSecondary PPH is the abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally.

 {"id":239, "name":"Ulcerative Colitis", "intro":"Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is defined as a chronic neuropathic pain that persists for three or more months following acute Herpes zoster (shingles) infection. It is a severe painful secondary phase, which may develop three to six months after the resolution of initial phase of Herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Pain has a dermatomal distribution and is confined to same dermatome as the rash. Herpes zoster infection results from activation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which remains latent in dorsal root ganglia since the first infection of chickenpox (varicella). Pain frequently precedes Herpes zoster infection (pre-herpetic neuralgia), and outlasts the herpetic rash by some weeks. It is more common in older individuals (develops in up to 75% of patients over 70 years of age) and is less common in individuals younger than fifty years of age.\n\n\tPost-herpetic neuralgia subsides eventually on its own. However, it may make patients suffer for years and may leave a band of anaesthetic skin. It may lead to muscle weakness as well, if it affects major motor nerve.\n\n\tPost-herpetic neuralgia is associated with persistent and, very often, refractory neuropathic pain. The neuralgia is excruciating with superimposed lancinating paresthesias. Pain may be constant or intermittent, aggravated by minor stimulus (allodynia) such as heat or touch, and is worse at night. The agony of pain leads to insomnia, anorexia, and changes in mood (severe depression).\n\n\tPost-herpetic neuralgia may produce multiple types of pain in patient e.g.\n\n\n\t\tConstant aching, deep, or burning pain\n\n\t\tParoxysmal lancinating pain\n\n\t\tHyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain)\n\n\t\tAllodynia (pain associated with non-painful stimuli)\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tPost-herpetic neuralgia is a psychosocial condition with a significant impact on the psychological, social, and physical functioning of an individual.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nHyodo M, Oyama T, Swerdlow M.

These drugs reduce viral shedding and help in resolution of symptoms.\n\nAnticonvulsant gabapentin: Gabapentin is effective in management of PHN. The mechanism of action of gabapentin is unknown.\n\nAnticonvulsant Pregabalin: Pregabalin reduces release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Treatment with pregabalin results in significant improvement, as is seen in controlled study.\n\nTricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs): Tricyclic anti-depressants block certain receptors and inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and thus block the painful stimulus. Examples are amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine and imipramine. Serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine and duloxetine have given promising results in the treatment of PHN. Recent studies have shown that venlafaxine may be of some benefit in patients who cannot tolerate other anti-depressants. Due to incomplete efficacy and side effects of monotherapy, many trials have been conducted to have a combined drug therapy. For example, combination of nortriptyline and gabapentin have been tried.\n\nOpioids: Opioids such as morphine and tramadol are shown to relieve pain of PHN. Earlier evidence favoured TCAs but latest controlled trials support opioids over TCAs.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nTopical therapy:\n\n\tDue to the associated side effects of systemic therapy, the focus has shifted to topical therapy. It is a convenient and pain-free self-administration by the patient. There is reduced frequency of administration, reduced systemic exposure due to limited absorption from the skin surface, and enhancement of patient compliance.\n\n\tLocal topical therapy includes\n\n\nLidocaine: 5% Lidocaine patch is a safe and efficient option of local therapy in case of localised neuropathic pain (LNP). Lidocaine patch is a targeted peripheral analgesic. It has high safety, efficacy, and tolerability and is a chosen treatment in case of local neuropathic pain.\n\nCapsaicin: 8% Capsaicin patch may be used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain either alone or in combination of other medicines. However, capsaicin may cause transient adverse effects such as erythema and pain.\n\nTopical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy: Topical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy may be used in place of systemic therapy. Intranasal 10% ketamine may be combined with topical 6% gabapentin, 10% ketoprofen, 5% lidocaine, or 10% ketamine cream.\n\nGabapentin: 6% Gabapentin gel patches have been tried. It is a recent advance in the treatment of PHN. Topical gabapentin provided rapid improvement of symptoms.\n\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS): Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is a recent advance in the management of PHN. Patients refractory to medical therapy may be treated with TENS. Patients with TENS report a significant decrease in pain. It is seen that whether use of TENS or antivirals, either alone or in combination, cannot completely prevent PHN. However, TENS is found to be most successful in reducing the incidence of subacute herpetic neuralgia.\n\nUltrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block: A patient with excruciating pain and not responding to any treatment was selected. Ultrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block helped in control of symptoms due to PHN.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tSurgical approaches such as stereotaxic trigeminal tractotomy and dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) treatment procedures have been described in the treatment of PHN.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},
 {"id":240, "name":"Urticaria", "intro":"Postpartum depression (PPD) is depression that occurs to a mother after a childbirth. PPD is defined as an episode of non-psychotic depression with onset within 1 year of childbirth. PPD can happen any time after childbirth. It often starts within 1 to 3 weeks after a childbirth and may last for weeks or months at a time.\n\n\tThe word \"postpartum\" means \"after birth,\" so \"postpartum depression\" is talking only about depression after the baby is born. For many women, this term is correct: they start feeling depression sometime within the first year after they have the baby. But some women start to feel depression while they're still pregnant and the term \"perinatal depression\" is used to describe this situation. The word \"perinatal\" describes the time during pregnancy or just after birth.\u00a0Researchers believe that depression is one of the most common problems women experience during and after pregnancy. Perinatal depression affects as many as one in seven women.\n\n\tThis type of depression does not only affect mothers. Sometimes new fathers also\u00a0experience postpartum or prenatal depression.\n\n\tFeelings of postpartum depression are more intense and last longer than those of \u201cbaby blues\u201d. It is a term used to describe the worry, sadness, and tiredness many women experience after having a baby. \u201cBaby blues\u201d symptoms typically resolve on their own within a few days.\n\n\tMothers with postpartum depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that may make it difficult for them to complete daily care activities for themselves or for others.\n\n\tPostpartum depression is a common complication of childbearing and as such represents a considerable public health problem affecting women and their families and make it an important medical condition to diagnose, treat and prevent.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/postpartum-depression.aspx\n\nwww.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml\n\nwww.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Postpartum-Depression?IsMobileSet=false\n\nwww.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/depression/index.htm", "symtoms":"The patterns of symptoms in women with postpartum depression are similar to those in women who have depression unrelated to childbirth, apart from the fact that the content may focus on the delivery or baby.\n\n\tSome of the more common symptoms a woman may experience include:\n\n\n\t\tFeeling sad, hopeless, empty, or overwhelmed\n\n\t\tCrying more often than usual or for no apparent reason\n\n\t\tWorrying or feeling overly anxious\n\n\t\tFeeling moody, irritable, or restless\n\n\t\tOversleeping, or being unable to sleep even when her baby is asleep\n\n\t\tHaving trouble concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions\n\n\t\tExperiencing anger or rage\n\n\t\tLosing interest in activities that are usually enjoyable\n\n\t\tSuffering from physical aches and pains, including frequent headaches, stomach problems, and muscle pain\n\n\t\tEating too little or too much\n\n\t\tWithdrawing from or avoiding friends and family\n\n\t\tHaving trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with her baby\n\n\t\tPersistently doubting her ability to care for her baby\n\n\t\tThinking about harming herself or her baby.\n\n\nPostpartum depression is different from the baby blues-\n\n\n\t\tThe \u201cbaby blues\u201d is a term used to describe the feelings of worry, unhappiness, and fatigue that many women experience after having a baby. Babies require a lot of care, so it\u2019s normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired from, providing that care. Baby blues, which affects up to 80 percent of mothers, includes feelings that are somewhat mild, last a week or two, and go away on their own.\n\n\t\tWith postpartum depression, feelings of sadness and anxiety can be extreme and might interfere with a woman\u2019s ability to care for herself or her family. Because of the severity of the symptoms, postpartum depression usually requires treatment. The condition may begin shortly before or any time after childbirth, but commonly begins between a week and a month after delivery.\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.cdc.gov/features/maternal-depression/index.html\n\nwww.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/lit_review_postpartum_depression.pdf", "causes":"Postpartum depression probably is caused by a combination of factors. These factors include the following:\n\n\nChanges in hormone levels just after childbirth: levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease just after child birth and these changes may trigger depression in the same way as smaller changes in hormone levels before menstrual periods trigger mood swings and tension.\n\n\n\nHistory of depression: Women who have had depression at any time-before, during, or after pregnancy, or who currently are being treated for depression have an increased risk of developing postpartum depression.\n\n\n\nEmotional factors: If the pregnancy is not planned or is not wanted, this can affect the way a woman feels about her pregnancy and her unborn baby. Even when a pregnancy is planned, it can take a long time to adjust for having a new baby. Parents of babies who are sick or who need to stay in the hospital may feel sad, angry, or guilty. These emotions can affect a woman\u2019s self-esteem and how she deals with stress.\n\n\n\nFatigue: Many women feel very tired after giving birth. It can take weeks for a woman to regain her normal strength and energy. For women who have had their babies by cesarean section, it may take a longer time.\n\n\n\nLifestyle factors: Lack of support from family members and stressful life events, such as a recent death of a loved one, a family illness, or moving to a new city, can greatly increase the risk of postpartum depression.\n\n\nOther risk factors may be-\n\n\n\t\tFamily history of depression\n\n\t\tA difficult pregnancy or birth experience\n\n\t\tGiving birth to twins or other multiples\n\n\t\tExperiencing problems in your relationship with your partner\n\n\t\tExperiencing financial problems\n\n\t\tBeing a teen mother\n\n\t\tPreterm (before 37 weeks) labor and delivery.\n\n\t\tPregnancy with birth complications.\n\n\t\tSmoking, drinking alcohol, and use of harmful drugs\n\n\t\tNegative thoughts and feelings about being a mother, these include\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHaving doubts that you can be a good mother\n\n\t\t\t\tPutting pressure on yourself to be a perfect mother\n\n\t\t\t\tFeeling that you\u2019re no longer the person you were before you had your baby\n\n\t\t\t\tFeeling that you\u2019re less attractive after having your baby\n\n\t\t\t\tHaving no free time for yourself\n\n\t\t\t\tFeeling tired and moody because you aren\u2019t sleeping well or getting enough sleep\n\n\n\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml\n\nwww.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Postpartum-Depression?IsMobileSet=false\n\nwww.marchofdimes.org/pregnancy/postpartum-depression.aspx\n\nwww.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml\n\nwww1.nichd.nih.gov/ncmhep/initiatives/moms-mental-health-matters/moms/Pages/default.aspx", "diagnosis":"A health care provider can diagnose a woman with postpartum depression.

Retinopathy of prematurity often regresses but has the potential of causing visual impairment or blindness. ROP causes disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels which may lead to retinal scarring or even detachment of retina.\n\n\tRetina has no blood vessels until fourth month of gestation. Thereafter, vessels emanate from hyaloid vessels at the optic disc and progress towards periphery. These vessels reach nasal periphery after eight months of gestation, but do not reach temporal periphery until about one month after delivery. Incompletely vascularised temporal part of retina is particularly susceptible to damage with oxygen therapy, particularly in premature infants. Pre-term birth affects normal retinal vascular maturation. Exposure to oxygen down-regulate retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in constriction/obliteration of blood vessels and delays normal retinal vascular development.\n\n\tSignificant ROP can lead to lifelong disability, especially in smallest survivors of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).\n\n\tReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/976220-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Retinopathy_of_Prematurity\n\nhttp://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/17471328\n\n\tKanski,Jack J.

This is the stage of hyperoxia-vasocessation.\n\n\tInitially, the retina derives oxygen by diffusion from the underlying capillary bed of choroidal layer. The retina continues to grow in thickness and outgrows its vascular supply.

This line is more prominent in peripheral part of temporal retina. It separates vascular posterior retina from avascular immature peripheral retina. Abnormal and branching blood vessels may form reaching up to the demarcation line.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stage 2 (Ridge formation): Demarcation line develops into a raised ridge of tissue which represents shunt joining veins with arteries.

This is because retinal detachment seldom develops before that and ROP rarely appears for the first time after 36 weeks. Before post-conceptual age of 31 weeks, screening is of limited value, because it is difficult to dilate pupils and there is vitreous haze due to the presence of tunica vasculosa lentis (capillary vasculature on posterior surface of lens which disappears after birth).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tCicatricial ROP:\n\n\tFew patients with active ROP develop cicatricial complications.

 {"id":247, "name":"Xerophthalmia", "intro":"Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome (RCES), a corneal epithelial adhesion disorder, is a painful, often frightening, and sometimes incapacitating condition of the cornea. Corneal epithelial cells undergo erosions and results in denuded areas on the corneal surface. These areas then re-epithelise, the process recurs and the epithelial cells slough again. With many patients, erosions are characteristically episodic in nature.\n\nHansen in 1872, first described a set of symptoms consistent with RCES, and referred to the disorder as \u2018intermittent neuralgic vesicular keratitis\u2019. Von Szily in the year 1900, described principal features of RCES. Paul Chandler in 1945, divided the syndrome into a macroform and a microform type, with the macroform being associated more frequently with trauma. However, later observations confirmed that the two forms may occur simultaneously and there is no sharp distinction between them.\n\n\tRCES may be diagnosed at almost any age and affects men and women equally. Even though the majority of patients give history of trauma, an underlying factor should be suspected when there is no history of trauma or surgery. Patients with RCES usually present with unilateral involvement, and the most commonly affected part is central part of the cornea just below the pupil. When the underlying cause is corneal dystrophy, symptoms are more often bilateral, localisation of the loosely adherent epithelium is more variable, and the management of symptoms often complicated. Trauma to the epithelium may be caused by a fingernail, plant material, sharp domestic objects, or the edge of a piece of paper. Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration is another common acquired disorder that may be associated with recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. Rarely, cases may occur spontaneously without any obvious predisposing factor.\n\n\tMost corneal erosions occur during the night or early morning hours and are described as an abrupt ripping sensation generally followed immediately by sharp pain, a marked foreign body sensation, watering, photophobia, visual disturbances, and often lid swelling. Some patients have mild symptoms every few months or years, and some experience severe, incapacitating, frequent erosions causing pain and other symptoms lasting for hours or days at a time.\n\n\tIn some patients with recurrent erosion, the epithelial defects never fully heal, and loose sheets of epithelium slide over the surface of the eye with each blink. These patients experience constant pain and may be some of the most distressed individuals. The unpredictable nature of recurrent erosions often heightens anxiety in patients. Patients may experience acute pain suddenly and would be unable to work or participate in normal activities for hours or days at a time.\n\n\tPatients may be relatively free of symptoms, except for perhaps a mild ocular foreign body sensation or vague \u2018awareness\u2019 of the affected eye between episodes of erosions. This sensation of awareness can be most noticeable in dry, cold or windy environments.\n\n\tIt is not uncommon for patients with severe erosions to display signs of depression and anxiety. Since most of the erosions occur during sleep or on awakening, some patients fear falling asleep and experience varying degrees of insomnia. Disruption in normal sleep patterns may exacerbate psychological stress as well as the experience of the symptoms. Anxiety may even make erosions more frequent by causing patients to open their eyes more quickly on awakening and by inducing more rapid eye movements (REMs) as well as interfering with normal blinking and tear production.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nYanoff Myron, Sassani Joseph W.

The trauma to the eye is usually minor. Injuries induced by fingernails to the cornea are particularly at high risk of progressing to RCES. Old literature refers to RCES as \u2018fingernail keratitis\u2019. Injuries with fingernails, paper, or tree branches are more likely to induce RCES as compared to injuries with objects such as glass, rock or metal. Corneal trauma involving penetration into deeper stroma is less likely to induce RCES.\n\nCauses of RCES are either primary or secondary depending on whether the basement membrane complex abnormalities are intrinsic or acquired. Secondary erosive disorders encompass all the conditions except corneal dystrophies.

Normal adhesion of the corneal epithelium depends primarily on structures known as attachment complexes, which are composed of elements from the basal epithelial cell, basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s membrane and corneal stroma.\n\n\tElectron microscopic examination and immunohistochemical staining methods shows that these elements possibly include hemidesmosomes, basal lamina, lamina densa, lamina lucida, anchoring fibrils, laminin, fibronectin, and Types IV and VII collagen. Abnormalities of epithelial adhesion resulting in recurrent erosions may be associated with previous traumatic abrasions or with corneal dystrophies.\n\n\tFollowing injury, corneal epithelial defect is filled rapidly by epithelial cells sliding from adjacent epithelial basal layers. After this, epithelial cells begin mitosis and produce supra-basal epithelial cell layers. Sliding of basal epithelial cells can take place over either pre-existing basement membrane or bare stromal collagen. If the basement membrane remains intact after trauma, the new epithelial cell layer becomes firmly attached within a week. However, if the basement membrane is removed due to injury, some corneas appear unable to re-form normal attachment complexes, resulting in recurrent erosions occurring up to many years after the original injury.", "diagnosis":"Patients of RCES develop pain, watering, redness and photophobia that may vary from mild to severe. Some present with disease every day, but others have recurrences that may vary from every week or month to longer periods of time without any symptoms. Typically, pain is more severe at night or upon waking in the morning and may be related to REM during sleep or on opening of the eyelid. Patients are usually aware of this and they try to open the eyes gently every morning, but others refer that they are awakened in the middle of the night because of the pain. In acute phase of the disease, corneal erosion is always present, commonly in the lower half of the cornea, irrespective of the aetiology. This area of the cornea is in permanent contact with the tear film and lower lid and is most exposed to the evaporative dry eye disease.\n\n\tThe combination of a previous history of minor trauma to the involved eye, episodes of pain on awakening, and a rough irregular area of healing epithelium, is diagnostic of RCES.\n\n\tComparing patients following trauma with patients who had RCES secondary to epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, patients with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy were significantly more likely to be symptomatic.\n\nClinical signs: \n\n\tCareful slit lamp examination is needed to find the subtle signs of this syndrome, since the epithelium in many cases had already healed. The appearance of the cornea on slit lamp examination between the episodes of clinical symptoms may be normal. Sometimes, however, various degrees of epithelial or sub-epithelial oedema, located in the area of former erosion, may be seen during the asymptomatic intervals. This oedema may be subtle (minimal bedewing), discernible only with retro-illumination on slit lamp. Alternatively, a fine linear sub-epithelial opacity of fine bubbles or a distinct sub-epithelial bulla may be visible.\n\nClinical signs at slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) may show:\n\n\n\t\tDelicate signs of basement membrane dystrophy.\n\n\t\tSites of previous erosion.\n\n\t\tClusters of small epithelial micro-cysts.\n\n\t\tGentle pressure applied to the cornea through the eyelid may demonstrate wrinkling of loosely adherent epithelium.\n\n\n\tIn many cases, no signs are found, and then the patient is instructed to return immediately after the next episode of pain, without allowing time for the epithelium to heal and cover the erosion. This will facilitate proper diagnosis and correct location of the lesion for the purpose of treatment.\n\nFeatures of acute attack or during the first few days following the attack, in corneal epithelium: \n\n\n\t\tLoosely adherent and elevated epithelium.\n\n\t\tEpithelial micro-cysts.\n\n\t\tCorneal epithelial defects.\n\n\t\tStromal infiltrates and opacities may also develop at the site of the erosions.\n\n\t\tMeibomian gland dysfunction.\n\n\t\tFeatures of corneal dystrophy.\n\n\t\tTear film break up time (BUT) is often diminished on the affected areas.\n\n\t\tRetro-illumination against red reflex (with dilated pupils) shows subtle changes of erosion in corneal epithelium.\n\n\t\tFluorescein stain may be negative. Corneal erosions are stained mainly by fluorescein, whereas devitalised but intact epithelium is stained exclusively by rose bengal.\n\n\n\tThe midline below the horizontal meridian is usually the last area to re-epithelise, and the closure lines at this area are predisposed to frequent breakdown. In addition, this is the area of maximal exposure, since it opposes the line of lids closure.\n\nWhen no obvious signs of RCE are evident on the slit lamp examination, the presence of impaired epithelial adhesion is detected by:\n\nTest for epithelial adherence: Epithelial adherence may be tested with a dry cellulose sponge, which is gently rubbed over the area of suspected epithelial erosion. If the intact epithelial sheet is moveable by the sponge, then the lack of adequate epithelial-stromal adhesion is suspected. Loosely adherent epithelium folds or break down, when touched with the tip of the sponge under local anaesthesia. Explore the inferior and central cornea, but any part may be affected.\n\nCorneal topography (using computerised videokeratography): Corneal topography often reveals focal areas of corneal flattening (called corneal topographic lagoons) in eyes with RCES. This finding is important in those patients having frank symptoms but do not show epithelial abnormalities. Corneal topography may show an irregular ocular surface, which may explain visual symptoms such as diminution of vision or monocular diplopia.\n\nHistology: The ultra-structural changes associated with RCES include:\n\n\n\t\tAbnormal basal epithelial cell layer.\n\n\t\tProminent basal cell oedema of the epithelium.\n\n\t\tAbnormal epithelial basement membrane.\n\n\t\tSeparation of the cells from their basement membrane.\n\n\t\tAbsent or abnormal hemidesmosomes.\n\n\t\tLoss of anchoring fibrils.\n\n\t\tBinucleated cells and multinucleated giant cells have been found in the corneal epithelium. Tonofibrils, prominent in the abnormal epithelial cells, are probably responsible for forming binucleated cells.\n\n\t\tAll layers of the epithelium are infiltrated with neutrophils.\n\n\nConfocal microscopy: Confocal microscopy in patients with RCES associated with anterior corneal dystrophies, discloses structural changes in the basal epithelium, basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s membrane, anterior stroma, and corneal neurons.\n\nElectron microscopy: Electron microscopy shows absence of hemidesmosomes and in some cases the absence of entire thickness of basement membrane. Thinning and splitting of basement membrane may also be present. Epithelial cells may be responsible for abnormal production and attachment of the basement membrane. The presence of high number of mitochondria with abnormal shape in the basal epithelial cells, seen as intracellular vacuoles, suggests an abnormal metabolic activity.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\n\nRecurrent breakdown of corneal epithelium may be seen in:\n\n\n\t\tExposure keratopathy.\n\n\t\tNeurotrophic keratopathy with painless corneal erosions.\n\n\t\tRecurrence of herpes simplex stromal keratitis and may show an epithelial defect. Past history of dendritic corneal ulceration, gradual onset of pain and deep stromal infiltration in herpes simplex stromal keratitis distinguishes this from true recurrent corneal erosion.\n\n\t\tHard and roughened tarsal plate.\n\n\t\tForeign body under the tarsal plate.\n\n\t\tSelf- inflicted corneal injury (rare).", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tTill date, no single therapy is found to be definitive and sufficiently effective. The therapy of RCES is palliative rather than curative. The disease may be annoying, but is not vision threatening.\n\nGoals of management:\n\n\nPrimary goals of management: The primary goals of management of RCES during the acute attacks include pain relief and promotion of fast and prolonged epithelialisation.\n\nLong-term goals of management: Long-term goals of RCES management are stabilisation of the healed epithelium and prevention of subsequent erosion episodes.\n\n\n\tThese goals are not easily achieved, and the chronic course of resistant cases of RCES may be frustrating for both patient and physician. Typically, a stepladder approach, beginning with conservative measures and moving on to invasive intervention, is followed. \u00a0\u00a0Adjuvant therapy e.g. cycloplegics, offer additional relief in symptoms.\n\n\tOver the years, multiple treatment strategies were developed, including topical conservative treatments, such as hypertonic lubricants, soft bandage contact lenses and various aggressive surgical modalities, such as anterior stromal puncture and phototherapeutic refractive keratectomy, which aim at creating a new basement membrane-epithelial interface.\n\n\tTailoring the proper treatment strategy to each patient is the key to a successful control of RCES.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\nMedical therapy includes:\n\n\nSlow eye movements on awakening and gradual lid opening.\n\nPatching and a topical antibiotic ointment: Patching and a topical antibiotic ointment may be applied in acute episodes of RCES.\n\nTopical artificial tears (lubricants): To prevent the disease, the most widely used therapies include topical lubricants. Topical lubricants can be administered as drops, gels or ointment. The bed time application of an ointment will reduce the amount of friction between the tarsal conjunctiva and corneal epithelium overnight, during the REM, and will protect corneal epithelium from the shearing action of the eyelids upon awakening, which is the major trigger of recurrence.\n\nHyper-osmotic agents: Hyper-osmotic agents are also routinely used in RCES. During sleep there is a relative hypo-tonicity of the tear film as a result of decreased tear fluid evaporation. The reduced tear osmolarity at night will cause a shift of water from the tear film into the cornea, resulting in a relative corneal epithelial oedema and decreased epithelial adhesion. Hypertonic (5%) sodium chloride, either drops or ointment, will promote epithelial adherence by increasing the tear osmolarity, thereby, decreasing epithelial oedema and promoting epithelial adherence. These agents should be continued for few months after the last attack, as it takes a few months for the adhesion complexes to build up.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tThe majority of cases are mild and do well with these conservative treatments (topical lubricants and hyper-osmotic agents), which are effective in relieving pain and promoting initial epithelial growth. However, these modalities will not reduce the likelihood of recurrences.\n\n\tUseful advice for patients is to move their eyes slowly to the left and right before opening them, and to gradually retract the lower lid, to facilitate gradual separation between the tarsal conjunctiva and the corneal epithelium. This slower separation of the cornea from the tarsal conjunctiva will prevent the shearing force created on the corneal epithelium during abrupt lid opening, and will prevent the erosion.\n\nOther medical therapy includes:\n\n\nOsmotic colloidal solutions.\n\nTemporary soft bandage contact lenses: Temporary soft bandage contact lenses promote epithelial migration and regeneration of basement membrane by protecting the corneal epithelium from the friction by the upper tarsal conjunctiva. To be effective, a bandage contact lens should be worn for few weeks to several months replacing it every two weeks. This may enable the formation of stable adhesion complexes between the corneal epithelium and the basement membrane.\n\n\n\tThese contact lenses should be used under close medical supervision, since long-term continuous use of contact lenses may lead to bacterial keratitis and neovascularisation. However, silicone hydro-gel extended wear contact lenses, in recent years, have significantly increased the safety of long-term use of bandage contact lenses.\n\n\tSoft bandage contact lenses are often not effective in preventing further erosions except in cases where abnormalities in lid anatomy play a significant causative role in the erosions.\n\n\nAutologous serum: Autologous serum has been used effectively in RCES, significantly reducing the incidence of recurrence. It is composed of substances that are essential for epithelial healing, such as vitamin A, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta, and fibronectin (FN). FN promotes epithelial cell migration and participates in the adhesion process. The lipids in the serum may act as a substitute for the lipids produced by the meibomian glands. Autologous serum is safe and no adverse effects have been reported with its use.\n\nUmbilical cord serum: Umbilical cord serum contains a higher concentration of growth factors and may be shown to be more effective in decreasing symptoms and keratoepitheliopathy in dry eyes and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. In a small study of patients treated with artificial tears alone compared with artificial tears along with umbilical cord serum drops, there was a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence, in later group. A large amount of serum can be obtained from the umbilical cord vein at one time and as a result, many patients can benefit from one sample. Also, the lack of major histocompatibility complex (HCC) class II expression and the low expression of major HCC class I on umbilical cord tissue-derived cells may result in reduced immunogenicity. The possibility of transmission of blood-borne diseases, storage requirements, risk of allergies, and the potential risk of bacterial contamination may be problematic issues. The use of umbilical cord serum for RCES may be found to be effective in reducing the number of recurrences.\n\nTrophic growth factors (TGFs): Numerous investigational trophic growth factors (TGFs) are demonstrated to be effective in treating some patients with erosion, especially in patients with more severe types of epitheliopathy, such as those associated with long-term diabetes mellitus or neurotrophic keratopathy.\n\nTreatment of lid disease: Certain diseases like meibomian gland disease (MGD) and chronic blepharitis are associated with RCES. The tear film in MGD may have increased levels of bacterial lipases, fatty acids, interleukins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may interfere with corneal epithelial healing. Therefore, the usual therapeutic measures of MGD should be used in RCES as well. These include lid hygiene and oral tetracyclines. Oral tetracyclines decreases episodes of RCES by reducing free fatty acids in the tear film of MGD, by inactivating the MMPs, and by reducing the numbers of colony forming units (CFUs) from lid cultures. Low doses of tetracyclines may be continued for a few months.\n\nBotulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid): Botulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid) may be done to cover the corneal erosions in RCES resistant to simple measures.\n\nOral matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors: MMP enzymes (MMP- 2 and MMP-9), produced by corneal epithelium as well, have roles in the wound healing process, and are part of the inflammatory activity in many ocular surface disorders. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, may be responsible for the degradation of anchoring molecules in the adhesion complexes of the basement membrane during epithelial healing. MMP inhibitors may be used in the treatment of resistant RCES. A combination of oral doxycycline and topical steroid has been used in recalcitrant cases of RCES. The combination of topical steroids and doxycycline can inhibit the inflammatory cytokines and MMPs and promote rapid resolution, and prevent further recurrence in RCES. The use of topical steroids in the treatment of RCES must, however, be weighed against the potential risks of infection, cataract and intraocular pressure elevation.\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tIn patients where consistent, aggressive medical management fails to resolve the erosions, surgical therapy may be required.\n\nIndications of surgery: \n\n\n\t\tAggressive medical management does not improve signs and symptoms of erosions.\n\n\t\tPatients continued pain and presence of epithelial defects, interfering with normal activities.\n\n\t\tPresence of recurring epithelial defects may result in infectious keratitis.\n\n\nChoice of surgical approach is determined by: \n\n\n\t\tFrequency and severity of erosions.\n\n\t\tPresence of concomitant dystrophy or other diseases.\n\n\t\tAetiology and location of erosions.\n\n\t\tPatients need and desires.\n\n\n\tSurgical therapy may be highly effective. Over the years, a series of surgical procedures have been described for RCES, including diamond burr polishing of Bowman\u2019s membrane, anterior stromal puncture\u00a0 with an insulin needle or with neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, and excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). As these procedures result in high success rates and carry low risks, it is advisable not to defer the surgical options if the medical therapy fails. Historically, debridement and then superficial keratectomy were the first surgical approaches to the treatment of RCES, and these procedures are still in use today.\n\n\nDebridement of loose epithelium: Epithelial debridement is indicated when a large area of the epithelium is loose and mobile with lid movements. Debridement of this large area of loose epithelium is necessary for pain relief, and can promote healing from the healthy adherent edges of the intact epithelium. Preoperatively, topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as eyedrops (bromefenac, ketorolac tromethamine or diclofenac) helps in pain management in patients for debridement. Epithelial debridement may be performed under topical anaesthesia using slit lamp, by removing the loose epithelium with a sterile sponge. \u00a0Postoperatively, these drops are continued and therapeutic bandage contact lens may be prescribed if the epithelial defect is large. Topical antibiotics and cycloplegic eye drops may be required. Epithelial debridement alone cannot reduce the recurrences of epithelial erosions.\n\n\n\tThe suboptimal efficacy and limitations of this procedure derive from the fact that no significant modifications to enhance epithelial adhesions are made in Bowman\u2019s membrane or other deeper corneal structures.\n\n\tA technique known as alcohol delamination of the corneal epithelium has been proposed to improve the efficacy of debridement in the treatment of recurrent erosions. Debridement and removal of abnormal or reduplicated epithelium are most effective in cases where localised areas of such epithelium interfere with visual acuity by inducing refractive changes.\n\n\nLarge superficial epithelial keratectomy: \u00a0Large superficial epithelial keratectomy is a more aggressive approach, generally requires the use of an operating microscope. This technique is much more likely to benefit patients with recurrent erosions. \u00a0Like debridement, preoperative topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as eyedrops (bromefenac, ketorolac tromethamine or diclofenac) helps in pain management in patients for superficial epithelial keratectomy procedures. Postoperatively, these drops are continued and therapeutic bandage contact lens may be prescribed.\n\n\nThe optimum candidate for this procedure is one having:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spontaneous multiple erosions in different areas of cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No history of trauma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Severe basement dystrophy, resulting in poor vision.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Large areas of loosely adherent irregular epithelium.\n\n\nAnterior stromal puncture using needle: Anterior stromal puncture is a highly effective and widely used technique, involving the use of a needle to make multiple shallow penetrations through the epithelium into anterior corneal stroma, thus, improving epithelial adhesion. When discussing with patients, the term epithelial reinforcement may be substituted for stromal puncture to allay patient anxiety. Epithelial reinforcement may be performed either between erosive episodes or through loose, irregular epithelium during an active erosive phase without the need for debridement. This procedure incites reactive fibrosis/ scarring, and production of extra cellular matrix proteins that are responsible for proper adhesion of the epithelium to its substrate. The procedure is performed under topical anaesthesia. Preoperative NSAIDS (ketorolac or diclofenac) and antibiotic cover (fluoroquinolone or other antibiotic) is given for management of pain and infection, respectively. \u00a0Fluorescein sodium may be instilled topically before the treatment to define the affected area. Perpendicular multiple superficial punctures are placed about 0.5mm apart in the affected area. Treatment is extended to 1-2 mm into the normal epithelium bordering the lesion, because the loose epithelium usually extends beyond the visible limits of the erosion. Treatment within the pupil area should be minimised, if possible. Since anterior stromal puncture may result in sub epithelial scars, its use is not advisable if the erosion directly involves the visual axis, since a central scar may result in glare and a reduction in visual acuity. Immediately after the treatment, a bandage contact lens is placed and antibiotics are given for about one week.\n\n\n\tOnce re-epithelialisation has occurred, hyper-osmotic ointments are used to lubricate and protect the delicate healed epithelial tissue.\n\nFailure of anterior stromal puncture treatment in few patients is due to small treatment area, and erosions then develop outside of the treated area. A second, larger treatment can often resolve erosions in patients in whom the initial procedure is unsuccessful.\n\n\tAnterior stromal puncture has also been tried/ used in patients with corneal erosions associated with bullous keratopathy. Although corneal stromal oedema is generally well tolerated, rupture of epithelial bullae and the resulting corneal erosions in these patients can be very painful. For some of these bullous keratopathy patients with erosions, who are poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty because of poor visual potential or medical contraindications, anterior stromal puncture has been shown to be a useful treatment. Anterior stromal puncture can also be used to control painful erosions in patients with bullous keratopathy who are awaiting corneal transplantation. The optimum patients for this type of treatment are those whose bullae are localised and not diffusely distributed throughout the cornea.\n\n\nAnterior stromal puncture using neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser: Anterior stromal puncture may also be performed with a short-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The advantage of laser puncture over needle puncture is that the laser puncture is more reproducible, shallow, and translucent.\n\nNeodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser keratectomy.\n\nMicrodiathermy.\n\nExcimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Partial ablation of Bowman\u2019s layer, with excimer laser PTK, provides smooth bed for migrating epithelium, and results in new hemidesmosomal adhesion complexes. The basal epithelial layer forms hemidesmosomes and new basement membrane within two weeks of laser photo-ablation. Thus, new hemidesmosomes, anchoring fibrils, and epithelial basement membrane are synthesised rapidly and in increasing amounts after PTK. In addition, removing the basement membrane allows the epithelium to come into direct contact with stromal elements, stimulating the synthesis of new anchoring fibrils and hemidesmosomes.\n\n\n\tThe aim is to remove a 6.0-mm diameter of thick anterior stromal layer. The eye is patched after putting cycloplegic and antibiotic drops. Bandage contact lens may be required during the postoperative period.\n\n\tPTK results in a higher rate of success for RCES following trauma than corneal dystrophies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advantages of PTK are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Removal of corneal tissue with extreme precision.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Precision helps in preventing damage to the non-ablated area.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simultaneous treatment of wider areas.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Disadvantages of PTK are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Postoperative discomfort.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hypermetropic (hyperopic) shift is caused by the central flattening of the cornea. More advanced PTK, based on flying spot beam profiles, is associated with fewer undesirable refractive changes, compared to those with older, broader beam lasers.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\nDiamond burr superficial keratectomy (DBSK): Epithelial debridement and diamond burr polishing of Bowman\u2019s membrane is another, less commonly used option in the treatment of RCES. This procedure includes the debridement of loose sheets of epithelium from the cornea using a combination of peeling with forceps and gentle wiping with a cellulose sponge. If the erosion is within the visual axis, the entire corneal surface is polished with a fine diamond burr. The limbal epithelium is left intact in 1-2 mm circumferential periphery. Treatment is limited to the anterior part of Bowman\u2019s layer. A bandage contact lens is applied and antibiotics are given following treatment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Advantages of diamond burr polishing are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The results of diamond burr polishing are comparable to those of PTK.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A subtle granular sub-epithelial deposit is initially noticed which clears in about three months postoperatively. A study on RCES and anterior basement membrane dystrophy showed significantly less haze after diamond burr polishing as compared to PTK.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diamond burr polishing is a simple, less expensive procedure with fewer recurrences as compared to PTK.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Diamond burr polishing can be used to treat RCES involving the visual axis.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\n\t\tOverall, the prognosis is very good to excellent with proper care.

 {"id":248, "name":"Yellow Fever", "intro":"Rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are major public health problems among children and young adults in developing countries; though RF/RHD has declined in developed countries. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to infection with the bacterium group A streptococcus (GAS). RF affects connective tissues, and may result in rheumatic heart disease which may progress to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and embolic stroke.\n\n\tRF and RHD are nonsuppurative complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis (sore throat) due to a delayed immune response. Group A streptococcal infection is endemic throughout the world, but epidemics are common, particularly among schoolchildren, in residential facilities for the elderly, and in other unique populations such as military personnel. ARF, considered as a classical disease of poverty, commonly appears in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years in developing countries. It occurs 1\u20133 weeks after an untreated GAS pharyngitis and is an inflammatory disease, with marked tendency to recur.\n\n\tThe consequences of RF and RHD include continuing damage to the heart, increasing disability, repeated hospitalization, and premature death.\n\n\tWorld Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 estimated that there are about 15.6 million cases of RHD world-wide. A vast majority of cases are in developing countries. About 2, 82,000 new cases of RHD and over 4, 70,000 new cases of RF occur every year, and 2, 33,000 people die due to RHD each year.\n\n\tIn India population based study indicates prevalence of RHD to be about 2/1000 population, however survey conducted in school children in the age group of 5-16 years by ICMR gives overall prevalence of 6/1000(range 1.8 to 11/1000).\n\n\tRheumatic fever is endemic in India and remains one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease, accounting for nearly 25-45% of the acquired heart disease.\n\n\tThe burden of ARF in industrialized countries declined dramatically during the 20th century, due to improved living conditions and increased hygiene standards, along with better access to appropriate health services and increased access to penicillin-based medications. In many developing countries, lack of awareness of these measures, coupled with shortages of money and resources, are important barriers to the control of the disease.\n\n\tEarly treatment of streptococcal sore throat can prevent the development of rheumatic fever. Regular long term penicillin treatment can prevent rheumatic fever becoming rheumatic heart disease, and can halt disease progression in people whose heart valves are already damaged by the disease. RF/RHD is a neglected public health problem in India. If treated, 75% of people with rheumatic fever recover completely. RHD is one of the preventable chronic disorders of heart.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.icmr.nic.in/final/\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\nwww.apiindia.org/pdf/medicine\n\nwww.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases", "symtoms":"Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is preceded by sore throat.

It is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial pharyngitis that leads to RF/RHD. Impetigo, a common skin infection, is also caused by S. pyogenes and is associated with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). In rare cases, S. pyogenes causes invasive diseases such as cellulitis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS).\n\n\tThe risk of an attack of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following GAS pharyngitis has been reported to be 0.3% under endemic conditions to 3% during epidemic conditions. During the winter and spring seasons in temperate climates, up to 20% of the school-aged children may be GAS carriers.

This is the second most common cause of facial paralysis and is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that remains dormant/latent in the geniculate ganglion after primary infection with chickenpox. Characteristic presentation is severe acute otalgia with unilateral facial paralysis. Vesicular eruptions if not present initially, may appear usually within three to five days. The vesicles may appear on post-auricular skin, pinna, concha, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. Occasionally it may affect neck, shoulder or oral cavity. Besides facial nerve, it may affect other cranial nerves as well.\n\nRamsay-Hunt in 1907 first described Herpes zoster oticus in a patient with otalgia associated with cutaneous and mucosal rashes, which was ascribed to geniculate ganglion infection with varicella zoster virus (human herpes virus type 3). This syndrome is also known by the names geniculate neuralgia or nervus intermedius neuralgia.\n\n\tAs compared to Bell\u2019s palsy, the symptoms are more severe and carries worse prognosis in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The risk and frequency of complete facial nerve degeneration is substantially higher than the Bell\u2019s palsy. Patients with vestibular and auditory dysfunction in addition to facial paralysis generally also have worse prognosis. Patients with diabetes, hypertension and advanced age have poorer prognosis.\n\nBilateral Ramsay Hunt syndrome has also been reported in diabetic patients or immunocompromised patients.\n\n\tOther cranial nerve neuropathies e.g. neuropathy of V,VI,VIII,IX, and X, may be associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences\n\nGross G, Doerr HW.

Health education programme should generate awareness regarding maintenance of both personal and environmental hygiene and about all the factors that predispose to GAS infection.\n\nPrimary Prevention is the treatment of acute streptococcal pharyngitis in order to prevent the initial attack of rheumatic fever. In general, once the diagnosis has been made, antibiotic therapy is indicated, thus preventing initial attack of ARF. The most appropriate antibiotic treatment for prevention of RF and RHD is Benzathine Penicillin G injection. The infection can usually be eradicated by a single intramuscular injection of Benzathine Penicillin G or by ten days treatment with oral penicillin. For patients allergic to penicillin, erythromycin is an acceptable alternative.\n\n\tEfforts to ensure primary prevention of RF should be focused on education of general community regarding proper treatment for sore throat. Health personnel also need to be trained regarding early diagnosis and effective treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. However, due to inadequate laboratory resources, diagnosis of GAS is usually not feasible in developing countries. It is difficult to distinguish GAS sore throat from viral sore throats on clinical basis.\n\n\tTill date, no effective vaccine is currently available against streptococcal diseases though a number of candidate vaccines are in development phase.\n\nSecondary Prevention- According to WHO, for all individuals who have had an initial attack of rheumatic fever, whether or not they have rheumatic heart disease, continuous administration of an antibiotic is mandatory to prevent infection of the upper respiratory tract by group A streptococci. Secondary prevention strategy has shown to reduce recurrences, morbidity and mortality.\n\n\tWHO recommends the regular intramuscular injection of repository penicillin (benzathine benzylpenicillin) every three to four weeks as a secondary prophylaxis. For patients for whom the regular and repeated injections of benzathine benzylpenicillin are not given, daily oral phenoxymethylpenicillin may be used. An oral sulfonamide is recommended for secondary prophylaxis to patients known to be allergic to penicillin (It is\u00a0not effective for treating established group A streptococcal infection). For individuals who cannot take either penicillin or sulfadiazine, erythromycin may be used.\n\nDuration of secondary prophylaxis-The duration of secondary prophylaxis depends on the several factors that affect the likelihood of recurrences of rheumatic fever such as the time since the most recent attack, the age of the patient and the risk posed by the environment. The duration of secondary prophylaxis should be adapted to the individual patient but some general principles are-\n\n\n\t\tPatients without carditits in a previous attack should have prophylaxis for a minimum of five years after the last attack, and at least until age 18 and often longer if risk factors are high.\n\n\t\tPatients with cardiac involvement in the initial attack should continue prophylaxis at least until the age of 25 years, and longer if environmental conditions or other risk factors warrant it.\n\n\t\tFor patients with chronic valvular rheumatic heart disease, secondary prophylaxis for prolonged periods, even for life, has sometimes been recommended.\n\n\t\tAntibiotic prophylaxis for secondary rheumatic fever should be continued through pregnancy with penicillin or erythromycin (sulfonamides present a risk to the fetus).\n\n\nTertiary Prevention is directed towards prevention of disability and premature death by surgical or medical management of heart failure and valve surgery, i.e., balloon mitral valvuloplasty or surgical mitral commissurotomy or valve replacement. The high cost of prosthetic valves, inadequate and limited facilities for operative procedures are barriers in provision of valve surgery to RHD patients in developing countries.\n\nJai Vigyan Mission Mode Project on community control of Rheumatic fever/Rheumatic heart disease in India was conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi from 2000-2010.The project report published in 2015 is a guide to experts/institutions involved with prevention and control of disease*.\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js2252e/3.2.1.html\n\napps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js2252e/3.2.2.html\n\n\t*www.icmr.nic.in/final", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.\n\nCutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, hides, wool, bones and skin.\n\nGastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea.\n\nPulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock.\n\n\tReferences- http://www.who.int/csr/disease/Anthrax/anthraxfaq/en/", "causes":"Anthrax is caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis, an encapulated and spore-forming bacillus.\n\n\tHumans generally acquire the disease from infected animals or as a result of occupational exposure to contaminated animal products.

 {"id":253, "name":"Solar Retinopathy", "intro":"Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis. \u00a0AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.\n\n\tThe incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.\n\n\tIn the year 1952, Hogan described bilateral conjunctivitis occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (coined the term atopic keratoconjunctivitis), which flared-up with worsening dermatitis. Patients notably showed chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis may evolve independent of dermatitis in some patients. Hogan\u2019s criteria to aid in diagnosis is presence or history of eczematous dermatitis, a family history of atopic disease, associated allergies (asthma, hay fever), eosinophilia and a characteristic keratoconjunctivitis associated with exacerbations of dermatitis. His patients were notable for chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation.\n\n\tAtopic keratoconjunctivitis represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). The potential for corneal involvement and opacification increases significantly with the CACs because of the severity and sustained nature of their inflammation. In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. However, clinical and patho-physiological features of AKC are quite different from other allergic conjunctivitis. \u00a0AKC like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a severe inflammatory disease, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment. The highest incidence of visual loss is therefore, found in AKC, the most chronic of these disorders.\n\n\tChronic allergic conjunctivitis characteristically involves an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated type I hypersensitivity response, manifested by papillary conjunctivitis, with itching as a universal early symptom. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with type I and a prominent T-cell mediated type IV response, along with variety of other inflammatory cell types and cytokines, contribute to the inflammatory changes of conjunctiva and cornea seen in AKC.\n\n\tAKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively, while SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis.\n\n\tAKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity. VKC is more frequently seasonal, and is generally worse in the spring season. AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in winter. Patients are sensitive to a wide range of airborne environmental allergens.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\n\tAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.Textbook of Ophthalmology Volume 1.First Edition.

Serum IgE levels are chronically elevated in AKC patients but their levels are not necessarily correlated to severity of disease.

Bulbar conjunctiva typically displays diffuse chemosis and injection.\n\n\t-\u00a0Conjuctival scarring: Conjuctival scarring may occur, often in reticular or septal pattern.\n\n\t-\u00a0Symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation: Sub-epithelial fibrosis can, in severe cases, lead to symblepharon formation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Forniceal foreshortening: Forniceal foreshortening may also result from sub-epithelial fibrosis.\n\n\t-\u00a0Limbus: Limbus may become infiltrated and oedematous, and develop gelatinous limbal thickening, consisting of confluent macro-papillae, is sometimes seen.\n\n\t-\u00a0Trantas dots: Trantas dots, tiny white lesions consisting of necrotic epithelial cells and eosinophils, may be observed, similar to those in VKC.\n\nCornea:\n\n\tCorneal disease may be complicated by late development of corneal hypaesthesia in patients with AKC, resulting in a paradoxic reduction in surface symptoms, including itching.\n\n\t-\u00a0Punctate epithelial keratopathy: Punctate epithelial keratopathy is the most common corneal finding.\n\n\t-\u00a0Filamentary keratitis: Filamentary keratitis may occur, sometimes with very thick mucoid filamentary strands and possibly related to tear film instability, due to goblet cell abnormalities and deficient mucin secretion, also commonly featured in AKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0Persistent epithelial defects: \u00a0Persistent epithelial defects frequently occur in the setting of a dry and inflamed ocular surface and may eventually lead to macro-erosions. Macro-erosions in atopic patient may progress to frank bacterial ulcers.\n\n\t-\u00a0Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation: Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation may also develop. Adherent mucus plaques contain epithelial debris, eosinophils, and inflammatory cells, and probably result from a combination of mechanical irritation from giant papillae, as well as toxic epithelial changes secondary to inflammation. Persistence of these plaques may eventually cause stromal thinning and perforation. The chronic inflammation and mechanical insult from palpebral scarring may result in partial or total limbal stem cell deficiency. Chronic inflammation and superimposed infection may lead to corneal scarring, neovascularisation, and lipid deposition. Vision may decline due to obscuration of the visual axis, irregular astigmatism, and/or ocular surface compromise.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pannus formation: Severe pannus often develops, typically affecting the superior one-third of the cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pseudogerontoxon: \u00a0Pseudogerontoxon may be seen in the peripheral cornea, which resembles a short, circumferential segment of arcus-senilis (white or grey opaque ring in corneal margin). This localised area of lipid deposition, related to abnormal vascular permeability at the limbus, may be the only evidence of previous atopic disease in a quiet eye.\n\nOther complications/features:\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid inflammation: Eyelid inflammation is common in AKC, often related to staphylococcal blepharitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis are found to have high rates of bacterial skin colonisation, specifically with staphylococcal species.\n\n\t-\u00a0Corneal super-infections: AKC patients are at higher risk of corneal super-infections because of an unstable ocular surface, the local bacterial colonisation of the eyelids, and a dysfunctional innate immune system. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, frequently bilateral, is another well known complication of AKC, and is presumably related to abnormalities in the atopic host\u2019s immune defences. Herpetic epithelial lesions may be recurrent, especially when topical or systemic immune-suppressants are required to control the atopic state. Management is especially difficult because epithelial AKC lesions may be difficult to distinguish from HSV keratitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0Development of cataract: Rapidly progressive cataracts frequently develop in AKC patients, classically described as anterior sub-capsular opacities, usually stellate or shield like in appearance. The pathogenesis for atopic cataract is unclear, and it is suggested that high levels of IgE may be correlated with development of cataract in these patients. The chronic use of topical steroids also predisposes to posterior sub-capsular cataracts in AKC patients. Other forms of cataract may form independent of corticosteroid use, especially in patients with severe systemic atopic disease.\n\n\t-\u00a0Keratoconus: A higher incidence of keratoconus is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pellucid marginal degeneration: A higher incidence of pellucid marginal degeneration is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Retinal detachment: Slightly higher rate of retinal detachment has also been noted in AKC patients. This may also be related to chronic eye rubbing, inducing degenerative vitreous changes.\n\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\n\n\tHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies of conjunctival specimens reveal increased number of mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes and neutrophils in AKC patients.\n\n\tMast cells and eosinophils have not only been detected in conjunctival epithelium, but are also present in increased numbers in the substantia propria. A surplus of Langerhans cells, macrophages and B cells in the substantia propria is also seen.\n\n\tT-lymphocyte infiltration is apparent in both conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria in AKC. T-helper (Th) cells predominate in all allergic eye diseases. Of the major T-cell subtypes, the Th1 subtype is involved in cellular immunity, whereas Th2 subtype is involved in humoral immune responses, including those mediated by IgE. Th2 cells are involved in eosinophil recruitment and stimulate IgE production from B cells. Th2 cytokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in AKC.\n\n\tActivated eosinophils recruit additional inflammatory cells to the ocular surface. They release chemo-attractants which attract neutrophils to the conjunctiva. Eosinophils are also major players in the development of sight-threatening corneal complications in AKC.\n\n\tConjunctival Epithelial cells and Fibroblasts express pro-inflammatory mediators in VKC. The expression of surface adhesion molecules and the release of cytokines by epithelial cells enhance recruitment of eosinophils. Conjunctival fibroblasts, when activated by Th cytokines, promote local accumulation of eosinophils and enhance eosinophil degranulation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSecondary structural changes:\n\n\tExtensive inflammation in AKC leads to chronic ocular surface alterations:\n\n\t-\u00a0Goblet cell loss/hyperplasia: Both goblet cell loss (based on impression cytology), as well as goblet cell hyperplasia (based on conjunctival biopsy) have been reported. Goblet cell production of mucin is altered.\n\n\t-\u00a0Tear film instability: Tear film instability, with increased tear break-up time (BUT) but normal tear production, has also been described.\n\n\t-\u00a0Corneal sensation: Corneal sensations are reduced in AKC..\n\n\t-Squamous metaplasia: Squamous metaplasia has also been described in patients with AKC.\n\nConfocal microscopy studies:\n\n\tAKC is associated with alterations in basal epithelium and sub-basal corneal nerves which relate to changes in tear function and corneal sensitivity. There is lower density of basal epithelial cells. \u00a0A decrease in number and density of sub-basal long nerve fibers causes decreased corneal sensation. Corneal nerves are thickened and have bifurcation abnormalities. Inflammatory cells and activated keratocytes are found in the superficial stroma.\n\nAKC should be differentiated from:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronic allergic conjunctivitis (e.g. VKC).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trachoma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSimilarities and differentiation from VKC:\n\nSimilarities:\n\n\t- Potentially blinding chronic disease: AKC and VKC are chronic, potentially blinding conditions.\n\n\t- Atopy: Both conditions present in individuals predisposed by an atopic background.\n\n\t- Hypersensitivity responses: Both diseases involve both type I and type IV hypersensitivity responses. Eosinophils and T lymphocytes are found to infiltrate the conjunctiva in both conditions.\n\n\t- Clinical features: Clinically, they are similar, with conjunctival inflammation, epithelial defects, shield ulcers, and corneal scarring as major features of both.\n\nDifferences:\n\n\t- Age groups: AKC presents at an older age than VKC. VKC usually \u2018burns out\u2019 by late puberty, whereas AKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\n\n\t- Visual prognosis: Visual prognosis is worse for AKC.\n\n\t- Peri-orbital skin and eyelid: There is increased peri-orbital and eyelid skin involvement in AKC as compared to VKC which generally spare skin.\n\n\t- Papillae: AKC usually presents with micro-papillae on the palpebral conjunctiva. Lower tarsus is preferentially involved in AKC, in contrast to VKC, in which papillae are much more prominent on the upper tarsus. Giant papillae are sometimes seen in AKC, but this is a definitive hallmark of VKC.\n\n\t- Eyelid margins: The eyelid margins are affected in AKC unlike VKC. Cicatricial changes, forniceal foreshortening, and symblepharon may be seen in AKC which are not usual in VKC.\n\n\t- Trantas dots: Trantas dots are more frequently associated with VKC than AKC.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tBecause of chronic nature of AKC, the balance of treatment efficacy and risk is often difficult. AKC is generally less responsive and requires more intensive and prolonged treatment.\n\n\tThe approach to management is multifaceted with the purpose of improving patient comfort and preventing the complications associated with AKC. Management involves multiple treatment arms viz. topical mast cell stabilisers, corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as topical cyclosporine. In more severe cases, systemic immune-suppression may be required.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\t-\u00a0Environmental allergens: Control of environmental allergens may be helpful, but antigen avoidance is usually an adjunctive therapy.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid hygiene: Because AKC involve the eyelids, in addition to the ocular surface, basic eyelid hygiene is essential. Eyelid scrubs should be part of daily routine in order to control blepharitis and the risk of staphylococcal keratitis. Antibiotic ointment may also be applied to the eyelid margins.\n\n\t-\u00a0Warm/cold compresses: Warm compresses improve tear film stability in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related to eyelid margin inflammation.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If severe itching or an exacerbation of peri-ocular atopic dermatitis is present, cold compresses will be more likely to provide symptomatic relief.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tAKC is primarily managed medically. However, elective surgery may be of benefit where inflammation is well controlled.\n\n\tThe goal of therapy should be the complete control of ocular surface inflammation with the safest medicines and lowest dosing needed to achieve this.\n\n\tMast cell stabilisers and antihistamines are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy. Antihistamines, steroids and immune-suppressants are used for immediate management of symptoms.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nEyelids:\n\n\t-\u00a0Emollients: Emollients applied to the eyelid skin help control peri-ocular eczema.\n\n\t-\u00a0Steroid ointments: Mild steroid ointments also help in controlling peri-ocular eczema. As with eye-drops, the duration of treatment should be minimised and the intraocular pressure monitored.\n\n\t-\u00a0Immunosuppressive agent: Tacrolimus ointment, a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, has also been shown to be effective in treating atopic dermatitis of the eyelids.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOcular surface:\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical artificial tears: Superficial punctate keratopathy requires aggressive lubrication, with preservative-free artificial tears and lubricating ointments, with the goal of increasing comfort and avoiding frank epithelial defects, which are typically more difficult to manage in atopes.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical antibiotic: If epithelial erosion does occur, topical antibiotic prophylaxis should be added to prevent bacterial super-infection and infectious keratitis, a complication of epithelial defects in AKC. All new epithelial defects should be cultured prior to initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n\t-\u00a0Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be applied to facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect.\n\n\t-\u00a0Scleral contact lenses: In patients with corneal epithelial or stromal irregularity but with good control of their AKC, scleral contact lenses may afford good vision and increased comfort, thus avoiding surgery.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent, may be used topically for dissolving mucus filaments and deposits, and addressing early plaque formation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical antihistamines: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of AKC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. These are generally not for continuous long term use, and several preparations are used in courses of limited duration. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.Topical antihistamines when used in isolation are about as effective as mast cell stabilisers. They are suitable for acute exacerbations but generally not for continuous long term use, and courses of several preparations are used in courses of limited duration.\n\n\t-\u00a0Systemic antihistamines:\u00a0 Systemic antihistamines help itching, promote sleep and reduce nocturnal eye rubbing. Because other inflammatory mediators are involved besides histamines, effectiveness is not assured. Some antihistamines (e.g.loratadine) cause relatively little drowsiness.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical mast cell stabilisers: Initial management of conjunctival inflammation may involve topical mast cell stabilisers. Topical mast cell stabilisers reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and the need for steroids and so form the basis of many regimens, but are seldom effective in isolation. Several days to weeks of treatment are needed for a reasonable response. The mast cell stabilisers include sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide and pemirolast, which may be effective as maintenance therapy in mild cases of AKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties, and are more frequently employed for allergic eye diseases. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action.Although these agents have little direct effect on the T-cell mediated inflammation, they may reduce overall induction of inflammation and, importantly, reduce mechanical eye rubbing, associated with the development of keratoconus and possibly AKC-associated cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve comfort by blocking non-histamine mediators. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\n\n\t-Topical corticosteroid therapy: More severe inflammation in AKC usually requires topical corticosteroid therapy. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile. Since the inflammation in AKC is on the ocular surface, corticosteroids with significant intraocular penetration should be avoided when possible. Steroid-related side effects, such as cataract and elevated intraocular pressure are often inevitable for AKC patients. Superior tarsal injection of corticosteroids is effective in refractory cases, though this treatment option may also be limited by side effects.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical immune-modulator drugs: Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, such as topical cyclosporine, have immune-modulatory effect by reducing Th cells, B cells and macrophages after treatment. Side effects include intense stinging and prolonged blurred vision. Tacrolimus ointment also inhibits T-cell production with greater potency than cyclosporine.\n\n\t-\u00a0Systemic immune suppression: \u00a0Advanced and refractory AKC may sometimes necessitate systemic immune-suppression, in order to prevent sight-threatening complications. Agents reported to be beneficial include prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and azathioprine.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The benefits of immune-suppressants, both systemic and local, must be balanced against the significant risk of infection, both bacterial and viral.\u00a0\n\n\t- \u00a0Allergen desensitisation: Allergen desensitisation may be effective in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\n\n\t-\u00a0Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis may be done in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\t-\u00a0Superficial keratectomy: Shield ulcer plaques, consisting of epithelial and inflammatory debris at the base of an ulcer, often are resistant to treatment with topical anti-inflammatory therapy. Superficial keratectomy may be required to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation. Medical treatment must be maintained until the cornea has re-epithelialised in order to prevent recurrences.\n\n\t-\u00a0Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is an alternative to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Penetrating keratoplasty (full-thickness corneal transplant): Corneal scarring and occasionally perforation may occur in severe cases and necessitate penetrating keratoplasty.\n\n\t-\u00a0Papillary resection: Papillary resection with or without mitomycin-C (MMC) application has been described as a method to reduce ocular surface inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Surface maintenance/restoration procedures: Surface maintenance/restoration procedures may be required for severe persistent epithelial defects or ulceration. Various procedures may be:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01.\u00a0 Amniotic membrane overlay grafting.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02.\u00a0 Lamellar keratoplasty (partial-thickness corneal transplant).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. \u00a0Eyelid procedures such as botulinum toxin-induced ptosis or lateral tarsorrhaphy (surgical fusion of upper and lower eyelid margin to narrow the eyelid opening). \u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04.\u00a0 Gluing may be appropriate for focal (\u2018punched-out\u2019) corneal perforations.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid surgery: In advanced AKC, extensive scarring of the ocular surface and eyelid margins may necessitate eyelid surgery. This includes lid margin tightening and rotational procedures for lid mal-position, as well as symblepharon lysis and forniceal reconstruction for severe conjunctival scarring.\n\n\t-\u00a0Cataract surgery: Many patients will require cataract surgery at a relatively young age due to atopic and steroid-induced cataract development.\n\n\t-\u00a0Glaucoma surgery: A few patients may need glaucoma filtering surgery or valve placement if steroid-induced glaucoma develops.\n\n\t-\u00a0Stem cell transplantation: Patients who develop limbal stem cell deficiency may require ocular surface stem cell transplantation for visual rehabilitation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tAssociated systemic conditions should be treated as well. Uncontrolled dermatitis with vision-threatening complications requires systemic steroids.\n\n\tAny associated Herpes simplex keratitis should be treated with topical antiviral agents. Recurrent attacks of Herpes infection may require systemic antiviral also.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tAKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\n\n\tProper prophylaxis, prompt treatment and planned surgical management can reduce the incidence of poor vision and blindness.\n\n\tAKC is a potentially blinding disease. AKC may result in diminished vision or blindness from superficial punctate keratitis, persistent corneal epithelial defects, corneal scarring or thinning, cataract, keratoconus and symblepharon formation.\n\n\tPatients should be observed frequently until the ocular surface disease is stable. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or immuno- suppressives, should have regular examination for drug-induced adverse effects.

 {"id":254, "name":"Anthrax", "intro":"Anthrax\n\nIntroduction-\n\n\tAnthrax is an infectious zoonotic disease (could be transferred from animals to humans). It is primarily a disease of herbivorous animals particularly cattles sheep, goats, horses and mules. The disease naturally occurs among herbivorous animals through contaminated soil and feed; among omnivorous and carnivorous animals through contaminated meat, bone meals or other feeds; and among wild animals from feeding on anthrax infected carcasses. Infected animals shed the bacilli in terminal hemorrhage or spilt blood at death. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years.\n\n\tHumans almost invariably contract the natural disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products.\n\n\tAnthrax is existed in many parts of the world, including Asia, southern Europe, sub-Sahelian Africa and parts of Australia. Anthrax also called Malignant pustule, Malignant oedema, Woolsorter's disease, or Ragpicker's disease\n\n\tAnthrax is enzootic (normally present in an area\u00a0in animals) in southern India but is less frequent to absent in the northern Indian States. In the past years the anthrax cases have been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Karnataka.\n\n\tIntegrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), National Centre for disease control (NCDC), Delhi, India reported 6 outbreaks of anthrax in India during the year 2014.\n\nBioterrorism and Anthrax:\n\n\t\u00a0Anthrax is considered an important biological warfare agent because:\n\n\t(i)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0it is highly fatal and when transmitted through inhalation is almost always fatal,\n\n\t(ii)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0anthrax spores can remain viable for several decades and can be easily produced in large quantities at a very low cost, and\n\n\t(iii)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0it is easy to weaponize and disseminate anthrax as an odourless and invisible aerosol which can affect thousands of people at the same time.\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tReferences-http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02723777\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Datta KK.

Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.\n\nCutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, hides, wool, bones and skin.\n\nGastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea.\n\nPulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock.\n\n\tReferences- http://www.who.int/csr/disease/Anthrax/anthraxfaq/en/", "causes":"Anthrax is caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis, an encapulated and spore-forming bacillus.\n\n\tHumans generally acquire the disease from infected animals or as a result of occupational exposure to contaminated animal products.

Contaminated animal products and vultures who feed on anthrax infected carcasses also spread the organism from one area to another.\n\n\tIncubation period of the disease is from a few hours to seven days.

 {"id":257, "name":"Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis", "intro":"Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis. \u00a0AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.\n\n\tThe incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.\n\n\tIn the year 1952, Hogan described bilateral conjunctivitis occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (coined the term atopic keratoconjunctivitis), which flared-up with worsening dermatitis. Patients notably showed chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis may evolve independent of dermatitis in some patients. Hogan\u2019s criteria to aid in diagnosis is presence or history of eczematous dermatitis, a family history of atopic disease, associated allergies (asthma, hay fever), eosinophilia and a characteristic keratoconjunctivitis associated with exacerbations of dermatitis. His patients were notable for chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation.\n\n\tAtopic keratoconjunctivitis represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). The potential for corneal involvement and opacification increases significantly with the CACs because of the severity and sustained nature of their inflammation. In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. However, clinical and patho-physiological features of AKC are quite different from other allergic conjunctivitis. \u00a0AKC like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a severe inflammatory disease, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment. The highest incidence of visual loss is therefore, found in AKC, the most chronic of these disorders.\n\n\tChronic allergic conjunctivitis characteristically involves an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated type I hypersensitivity response, manifested by papillary conjunctivitis, with itching as a universal early symptom. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with type I and a prominent T-cell mediated type IV response, along with variety of other inflammatory cell types and cytokines, contribute to the inflammatory changes of conjunctiva and cornea seen in AKC.\n\n\tAKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively, while SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis.\n\n\tAKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity. VKC is more frequently seasonal, and is generally worse in the spring season. AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in winter. Patients are sensitive to a wide range of airborne environmental allergens.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\n\tAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.Textbook of Ophthalmology Volume 1.First Edition.

AKC may, however, represent either a common manifestation end point for a number of abnormal gene processes, or a single gene defect with variable phenotypic expression, modified by other gene polymorphisms and the environment.\n\nEpithelial barrier defect:\n\n\tMore recent studies suggest that an epithelial barrier defect may be responsible rather than a defect in immune-regulatory function.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nAtopic (genetic tendency to develop allergic disease) systemic diseases with which AKC may be associated are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dermatitis is most common.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eczema.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Asthma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hay Fever.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Migraine.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Urticaria (hives).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rhinitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Food allergies (less common).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-hereditary angioedema (less common).\n\nAKC may be associated with other ocular diseases like:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anterior sub-capsular cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Posterior sub-capsular cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronic staphylococcal blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal detachment.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of AKC is based upon typical clinical features.\n\n\tDespite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease.\n\n\tHistory of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in AKC.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOcular clinical features:\n\nPeri-orbital features:\n\n\t-\u00a0Dermatitis: Scaling, flaky dermatitis consistent with eczema on peri-orbital skin.\n\n\t-\u00a0Hyperpigmentation: Peri-orbital hyper-pigmentation, which may lighten in response to control of inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0de Hertoghe sign: de Hertoghe sign or absence of lateral eyebrow, is occasionally seen and may be related to chronic eye rubbing.\n\nEyelids:\n\n\t-\u00a0Dermatitis: Scaling, flaky dermatitis with reddened base, consistent with eczema on eyelids.\n\n\t-\u00a0Vertical corrugations: Vertical corrugations near medial canthus of upper and lower eyelid may result.\n\n\t-\u00a0Fissured eyelid skin: Eyelid skin is often fissured.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid margin thickening: Eyelid margins may be thickened, oedematous and hyperaemic.\n\n\t-\u00a0Dennie-Morgan lines: Eyelid oedema may lead to Dennie-Morgan lines, single or double creases in the lower eyelid, secondary to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Lateral canthal ulceration: Lateral canthal ulceration related to chronic tearing may be present.\n\n\t-\u00a0Lid mal-position: Lid mal-position may result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation, resulting into:\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.

Lid margins may show loss of cilia and punctal ectropion.\n\n\t-\u00a0Permanent lid swelling: Chronic oedema may lead to permanent lid swelling, a hallmark of long-standing atopic eye disease.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid margin keratinisation: Keratinisation of eyelid margins is sometimes observed, along with associated meibomitis (inflammation of meibomian glands) and obliteration of meibomian glands.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nConjunctiva:\n\n\t-\u00a0Palpebral conjunctiva:\u00a0 Palpebral conjunctiva shows papillary hypertrophy, more prominent on lower tarsus.\n\n\t-\u00a0Giant papillae: Giant papillae like VKC may form.\n\n\t-\u00a0Oedema: Diffuse sheet-like infiltration of conjunctiva may lead to pale white oedema and obscuration of blood vessels. Bulbar conjunctiva typically displays diffuse chemosis and injection.\n\n\t-\u00a0Conjuctival scarring: Conjuctival scarring may occur, often in reticular or septal pattern.\n\n\t-\u00a0Symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation: Sub-epithelial fibrosis can, in severe cases, lead to symblepharon formation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Forniceal foreshortening: Forniceal foreshortening may also result from sub-epithelial fibrosis.\n\n\t-\u00a0Limbus: Limbus may become infiltrated and oedematous, and develop gelatinous limbal thickening, consisting of confluent macro-papillae, is sometimes seen.\n\n\t-\u00a0Trantas dots: Trantas dots, tiny white lesions consisting of necrotic epithelial cells and eosinophils, may be observed, similar to those in VKC.\n\nCornea:\n\n\tCorneal disease may be complicated by late development of corneal hypaesthesia in patients with AKC, resulting in a paradoxic reduction in surface symptoms, including itching.\n\n\t-\u00a0Punctate epithelial keratopathy: Punctate epithelial keratopathy is the most common corneal finding.\n\n\t-\u00a0Filamentary keratitis: Filamentary keratitis may occur, sometimes with very thick mucoid filamentary strands and possibly related to tear film instability, due to goblet cell abnormalities and deficient mucin secretion, also commonly featured in AKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0Persistent epithelial defects: \u00a0Persistent epithelial defects frequently occur in the setting of a dry and inflamed ocular surface and may eventually lead to macro-erosions. Macro-erosions in atopic patient may progress to frank bacterial ulcers.\n\n\t-\u00a0Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation: Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation may also develop. Adherent mucus plaques contain epithelial debris, eosinophils, and inflammatory cells, and probably result from a combination of mechanical irritation from giant papillae, as well as toxic epithelial changes secondary to inflammation. Persistence of these plaques may eventually cause stromal thinning and perforation. The chronic inflammation and mechanical insult from palpebral scarring may result in partial or total limbal stem cell deficiency. Chronic inflammation and superimposed infection may lead to corneal scarring, neovascularisation, and lipid deposition. Vision may decline due to obscuration of the visual axis, irregular astigmatism, and/or ocular surface compromise.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pannus formation: Severe pannus often develops, typically affecting the superior one-third of the cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pseudogerontoxon: \u00a0Pseudogerontoxon may be seen in the peripheral cornea, which resembles a short, circumferential segment of arcus-senilis (white or grey opaque ring in corneal margin). This localised area of lipid deposition, related to abnormal vascular permeability at the limbus, may be the only evidence of previous atopic disease in a quiet eye.\n\nOther complications/features:\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid inflammation: Eyelid inflammation is common in AKC, often related to staphylococcal blepharitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis are found to have high rates of bacterial skin colonisation, specifically with staphylococcal species.\n\n\t-\u00a0Corneal super-infections: AKC patients are at higher risk of corneal super-infections because of an unstable ocular surface, the local bacterial colonisation of the eyelids, and a dysfunctional innate immune system. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, frequently bilateral, is another well known complication of AKC, and is presumably related to abnormalities in the atopic host\u2019s immune defences. Herpetic epithelial lesions may be recurrent, especially when topical or systemic immune-suppressants are required to control the atopic state. Management is especially difficult because epithelial AKC lesions may be difficult to distinguish from HSV keratitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0Development of cataract: Rapidly progressive cataracts frequently develop in AKC patients, classically described as anterior sub-capsular opacities, usually stellate or shield like in appearance. The pathogenesis for atopic cataract is unclear, and it is suggested that high levels of IgE may be correlated with development of cataract in these patients. The chronic use of topical steroids also predisposes to posterior sub-capsular cataracts in AKC patients. Other forms of cataract may form independent of corticosteroid use, especially in patients with severe systemic atopic disease.\n\n\t-\u00a0Keratoconus: A higher incidence of keratoconus is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Pellucid marginal degeneration: A higher incidence of pellucid marginal degeneration is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\t-\u00a0Retinal detachment: Slightly higher rate of retinal detachment has also been noted in AKC patients. This may also be related to chronic eye rubbing, inducing degenerative vitreous changes.\n\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\n\n\tHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies of conjunctival specimens reveal increased number of mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes and neutrophils in AKC patients.\n\n\tMast cells and eosinophils have not only been detected in conjunctival epithelium, but are also present in increased numbers in the substantia propria. A surplus of Langerhans cells, macrophages and B cells in the substantia propria is also seen.\n\n\tT-lymphocyte infiltration is apparent in both conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria in AKC. T-helper (Th) cells predominate in all allergic eye diseases. Of the major T-cell subtypes, the Th1 subtype is involved in cellular immunity, whereas Th2 subtype is involved in humoral immune responses, including those mediated by IgE. Th2 cells are involved in eosinophil recruitment and stimulate IgE production from B cells. Th2 cytokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in AKC.\n\n\tActivated eosinophils recruit additional inflammatory cells to the ocular surface. They release chemo-attractants which attract neutrophils to the conjunctiva. Eosinophils are also major players in the development of sight-threatening corneal complications in AKC.\n\n\tConjunctival Epithelial cells and Fibroblasts express pro-inflammatory mediators in VKC. The expression of surface adhesion molecules and the release of cytokines by epithelial cells enhance recruitment of eosinophils. Conjunctival fibroblasts, when activated by Th cytokines, promote local accumulation of eosinophils and enhance eosinophil degranulation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSecondary structural changes:\n\n\tExtensive inflammation in AKC leads to chronic ocular surface alterations:\n\n\t-\u00a0Goblet cell loss/hyperplasia: Both goblet cell loss (based on impression cytology), as well as goblet cell hyperplasia (based on conjunctival biopsy) have been reported. Goblet cell production of mucin is altered.\n\n\t-\u00a0Tear film instability: Tear film instability, with increased tear break-up time (BUT) but normal tear production, has also been described.\n\n\t-\u00a0Corneal sensation: Corneal sensations are reduced in AKC..\n\n\t-Squamous metaplasia: Squamous metaplasia has also been described in patients with AKC.\n\nConfocal microscopy studies:\n\n\tAKC is associated with alterations in basal epithelium and sub-basal corneal nerves which relate to changes in tear function and corneal sensitivity. There is lower density of basal epithelial cells. \u00a0A decrease in number and density of sub-basal long nerve fibers causes decreased corneal sensation. Corneal nerves are thickened and have bifurcation abnormalities. Inflammatory cells and activated keratocytes are found in the superficial stroma.\n\nAKC should be differentiated from:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chronic allergic conjunctivitis (e.g. VKC).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trachoma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSimilarities and differentiation from VKC:\n\nSimilarities:\n\n\t- Potentially blinding chronic disease: AKC and VKC are chronic, potentially blinding conditions.\n\n\t- Atopy: Both conditions present in individuals predisposed by an atopic background.\n\n\t- Hypersensitivity responses: Both diseases involve both type I and type IV hypersensitivity responses. Eosinophils and T lymphocytes are found to infiltrate the conjunctiva in both conditions.\n\n\t- Clinical features: Clinically, they are similar, with conjunctival inflammation, epithelial defects, shield ulcers, and corneal scarring as major features of both.\n\nDifferences:\n\n\t- Age groups: AKC presents at an older age than VKC. VKC usually \u2018burns out\u2019 by late puberty, whereas AKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\n\n\t- Visual prognosis: Visual prognosis is worse for AKC.\n\n\t- Peri-orbital skin and eyelid: There is increased peri-orbital and eyelid skin involvement in AKC as compared to VKC which generally spare skin.\n\n\t- Papillae: AKC usually presents with micro-papillae on the palpebral conjunctiva. Lower tarsus is preferentially involved in AKC, in contrast to VKC, in which papillae are much more prominent on the upper tarsus. Giant papillae are sometimes seen in AKC, but this is a definitive hallmark of VKC.\n\n\t- Eyelid margins: The eyelid margins are affected in AKC unlike VKC. Cicatricial changes, forniceal foreshortening, and symblepharon may be seen in AKC which are not usual in VKC.\n\n\t- Trantas dots: Trantas dots are more frequently associated with VKC than AKC.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tBecause of chronic nature of AKC, the balance of treatment efficacy and risk is often difficult. AKC is generally less responsive and requires more intensive and prolonged treatment.\n\n\tThe approach to management is multifaceted with the purpose of improving patient comfort and preventing the complications associated with AKC. Management involves multiple treatment arms viz. topical mast cell stabilisers, corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as topical cyclosporine. In more severe cases, systemic immune-suppression may be required.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\t-\u00a0Environmental allergens: Control of environmental allergens may be helpful, but antigen avoidance is usually an adjunctive therapy.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid hygiene: Because AKC involve the eyelids, in addition to the ocular surface, basic eyelid hygiene is essential. Eyelid scrubs should be part of daily routine in order to control blepharitis and the risk of staphylococcal keratitis. Antibiotic ointment may also be applied to the eyelid margins.\n\n\t-\u00a0Warm/cold compresses: Warm compresses improve tear film stability in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related to eyelid margin inflammation.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If severe itching or an exacerbation of peri-ocular atopic dermatitis is present, cold compresses will be more likely to provide symptomatic relief.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tAKC is primarily managed medically. However, elective surgery may be of benefit where inflammation is well controlled.\n\n\tThe goal of therapy should be the complete control of ocular surface inflammation with the safest medicines and lowest dosing needed to achieve this.\n\n\tMast cell stabilisers and antihistamines are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy. Antihistamines, steroids and immune-suppressants are used for immediate management of symptoms.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nEyelids:\n\n\t-\u00a0Emollients: Emollients applied to the eyelid skin help control peri-ocular eczema.\n\n\t-\u00a0Steroid ointments: Mild steroid ointments also help in controlling peri-ocular eczema. As with eye-drops, the duration of treatment should be minimised and the intraocular pressure monitored.\n\n\t-\u00a0Immunosuppressive agent: Tacrolimus ointment, a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, has also been shown to be effective in treating atopic dermatitis of the eyelids.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nOcular surface:\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical artificial tears: Superficial punctate keratopathy requires aggressive lubrication, with preservative-free artificial tears and lubricating ointments, with the goal of increasing comfort and avoiding frank epithelial defects, which are typically more difficult to manage in atopes.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical antibiotic: If epithelial erosion does occur, topical antibiotic prophylaxis should be added to prevent bacterial super-infection and infectious keratitis, a complication of epithelial defects in AKC. All new epithelial defects should be cultured prior to initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n\t-\u00a0Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be applied to facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect.\n\n\t-\u00a0Scleral contact lenses: In patients with corneal epithelial or stromal irregularity but with good control of their AKC, scleral contact lenses may afford good vision and increased comfort, thus avoiding surgery.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent, may be used topically for dissolving mucus filaments and deposits, and addressing early plaque formation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical antihistamines: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of AKC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. These are generally not for continuous long term use, and several preparations are used in courses of limited duration. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.Topical antihistamines when used in isolation are about as effective as mast cell stabilisers. They are suitable for acute exacerbations but generally not for continuous long term use, and courses of several preparations are used in courses of limited duration.\n\n\t-\u00a0Systemic antihistamines:\u00a0 Systemic antihistamines help itching, promote sleep and reduce nocturnal eye rubbing. Because other inflammatory mediators are involved besides histamines, effectiveness is not assured. Some antihistamines (e.g.loratadine) cause relatively little drowsiness.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical mast cell stabilisers: Initial management of conjunctival inflammation may involve topical mast cell stabilisers. Topical mast cell stabilisers reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and the need for steroids and so form the basis of many regimens, but are seldom effective in isolation. Several days to weeks of treatment are needed for a reasonable response. The mast cell stabilisers include sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide and pemirolast, which may be effective as maintenance therapy in mild cases of AKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties, and are more frequently employed for allergic eye diseases. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action.Although these agents have little direct effect on the T-cell mediated inflammation, they may reduce overall induction of inflammation and, importantly, reduce mechanical eye rubbing, associated with the development of keratoconus and possibly AKC-associated cataract.\n\n\t-\u00a0Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve comfort by blocking non-histamine mediators. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\n\n\t-Topical corticosteroid therapy: More severe inflammation in AKC usually requires topical corticosteroid therapy. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile. Since the inflammation in AKC is on the ocular surface, corticosteroids with significant intraocular penetration should be avoided when possible. Steroid-related side effects, such as cataract and elevated intraocular pressure are often inevitable for AKC patients. Superior tarsal injection of corticosteroids is effective in refractory cases, though this treatment option may also be limited by side effects.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical immune-modulator drugs: Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, such as topical cyclosporine, have immune-modulatory effect by reducing Th cells, B cells and macrophages after treatment. Side effects include intense stinging and prolonged blurred vision. Tacrolimus ointment also inhibits T-cell production with greater potency than cyclosporine.\n\n\t-\u00a0Systemic immune suppression: \u00a0Advanced and refractory AKC may sometimes necessitate systemic immune-suppression, in order to prevent sight-threatening complications. Agents reported to be beneficial include prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and azathioprine.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The benefits of immune-suppressants, both systemic and local, must be balanced against the significant risk of infection, both bacterial and viral.\u00a0\n\n\t- \u00a0Allergen desensitisation: Allergen desensitisation may be effective in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\n\n\t-\u00a0Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis may be done in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\t-\u00a0Superficial keratectomy: Shield ulcer plaques, consisting of epithelial and inflammatory debris at the base of an ulcer, often are resistant to treatment with topical anti-inflammatory therapy. Superficial keratectomy may be required to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation. Medical treatment must be maintained until the cornea has re-epithelialised in order to prevent recurrences.\n\n\t-\u00a0Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is an alternative to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Penetrating keratoplasty (full-thickness corneal transplant): Corneal scarring and occasionally perforation may occur in severe cases and necessitate penetrating keratoplasty.\n\n\t-\u00a0Papillary resection: Papillary resection with or without mitomycin-C (MMC) application has been described as a method to reduce ocular surface inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Surface maintenance/restoration procedures: Surface maintenance/restoration procedures may be required for severe persistent epithelial defects or ulceration. Various procedures may be:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01.\u00a0 Amniotic membrane overlay grafting.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02.\u00a0 Lamellar keratoplasty (partial-thickness corneal transplant).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. \u00a0Eyelid procedures such as botulinum toxin-induced ptosis or lateral tarsorrhaphy (surgical fusion of upper and lower eyelid margin to narrow the eyelid opening). \u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04.\u00a0 Gluing may be appropriate for focal (\u2018punched-out\u2019) corneal perforations.\n\n\t-\u00a0Eyelid surgery: In advanced AKC, extensive scarring of the ocular surface and eyelid margins may necessitate eyelid surgery. This includes lid margin tightening and rotational procedures for lid mal-position, as well as symblepharon lysis and forniceal reconstruction for severe conjunctival scarring.\n\n\t-\u00a0Cataract surgery: Many patients will require cataract surgery at a relatively young age due to atopic and steroid-induced cataract development.\n\n\t-\u00a0Glaucoma surgery: A few patients may need glaucoma filtering surgery or valve placement if steroid-induced glaucoma develops.\n\n\t-\u00a0Stem cell transplantation: Patients who develop limbal stem cell deficiency may require ocular surface stem cell transplantation for visual rehabilitation.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tAssociated systemic conditions should be treated as well. Uncontrolled dermatitis with vision-threatening complications requires systemic steroids.\n\n\tAny associated Herpes simplex keratitis should be treated with topical antiviral agents. Recurrent attacks of Herpes infection may require systemic antiviral also.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tAKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\n\n\tProper prophylaxis, prompt treatment and planned surgical management can reduce the incidence of poor vision and blindness.\n\n\tAKC is a potentially blinding disease.

Blepharospasm is unilateral to begin with but usually eventually evolves into a bilateral condition. Blepharospasm usually lasts for minutes to hours together. Blepharospasm has a variable course and may be intermittent or continuous. It is slowly progressive in most of the patients.\u00a0\n\n\tExcessive blinking may lead to unilateral mild twitches, but may progress to bilateral, frequent and forceful spasms. During severe episodes, patient is unable to open the eyelids which may be associated with severe pain and functional blindness and may interfere with daily routine activities. Severe blepharospasm may cause high level of distress and psychosocial impairment causing anxiety, depression, avoidance of social contact and occupational problems. Blepharospasm reduces while concentrating on a specific task or during sleep.\n\n\tBlepharospasm may be associated with apraxia (loss of ability to perform activity) of eyelid opening i.e. inhibition of proper functioning of levator palpebrae superioris muscle.

Meibomian gland secretions may be turbid and contain particulate debris. Firm pressure on tarsal glands show inspissated secretions.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tObliteration of main meibomian ducts may cause secondary cystic dilatation and formation of chalazion (meibomian cyst).

 {"id":261, "name":"Childhood Exotropia", "intro":"Childhood exotropia (outward deviation) is a horizontal exodeviation characterised by visual axis forming a divergent angle. It usually begins as exophoria. Exophoria is a condition in which eyes are straight without deviation when both eyes are open. However, eye under cover deviates on cover-uncover test or alternate cover test. It may progress to exotropia which may be latent (exophoria) or manifest (Exotropia). Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia.\n\nClassification of childhood exotropia:\n\n\tIt is broadly classified as:\n\n\n\t\tIntermittent exotropia\n\n\nConstant exotropia:\n\n\tConstant exotropia may be of following types:-\n\n\n\t\tCongenital exotropia\n\n\t\tDecompensated intermittent exotropia\n\n\t\tSensory deprivation exotropia\n\n\t\tConsecutive exotropia\n\n\n\tAccording to distance-near relationships, exodeviations may be further subdivided as (Duane classification):-\n\n\tConvergence insufficiency exotropia: Due to convergence insufficiency, exotropia is worse for near vision.\n\n\tDivergence excess: Due to divergence excess, exotropia is worse for distance vision.\n\n\tBasic exotropia: Exotropia is equal for both near and distance vision.\n\n\tIntermittent exotropia:\n\n\tIntermittent exotropia frequently begins around the age of two years. A child with intermittent exotropia does not develop diplopia (double vision) due to bitemporal suppression, unlike acquired manifest exotropia in adults. With progressive suppression, constant exotropia may develop. Development of amblyopia (functional suppression of retina) is very rare. Manifest exotropia may be precipitated by factors such as fatigue, light glare, ill-health or visual distraction.\n\n\tCongenital exotropia:\n\n\tCongenital exotropia is rare and present at birth and may be associated with neurological abnormalities like cerebral palsy, midline defects or craniofacial syndromes. Infantile exotropia manifests during the first year of life.\n\n\tDecompensated intermittent exotropia:\n\n\tManifest intermittent exotropia may increase with time and become constant exotropia.\n\n\tSensory deprivation exotropia:\n\n\tSensory deprivation exotropia is due to disruption of binocular reflexes by acquired conditions like opaque media due to a disease or cataract. It begins in children over five years of age or in adults.\n\n\tConsecutive exotropia:\n\n\tConsecutive exotropia may develop following surgical overcorrection of esotropia (inward deviation of eyes), especially in an eye which is amblyopic. Occasionally, a deeply amblyopic convergent eye may become divergent (acquire resting position of eye).\n\n\tSecondary exotropia results from a primary sensory deficit (sensory deprivation exotropia) or occurs as a result of treatment for esotropia (consecutive exotropia).\n\nReferences:\n\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1199004-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1199102-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.aao.org/Intermittent_Exotropia\n\nhttli://eyewiki.aao.org/Exotroliia\n\nhttli://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/liubmed/10532736\n\nhttli://www.aoa.org/documents/olitometrists/CliG-12.lidf\n\nbjo.bmj.com/content/67/8/546.full.lidf\n\n\t\tKanski, Jack J.

This deviation may be noted by the parents or is detected on eye examination.\n\n\tThe degree of deviation may be different in primary (straight gaze) and lateral (side) gaze positions. This is important to record from surgical point of view, to avoid post operative diplopia in lateral gaze.\n\n\tIntermittent exotropia:\n\n\tPatients with intermittent exotropia rarely have any complaints due to well developed suppression mechanism. Patient may have symptoms like eyestrain, headache, blurring of vision or difficulty in prolonged reading. However, these symptoms are quickly controlled by development of sensory adaptation. Not all intermittent exotropias are progressive. The deviation may remain stable for many years. The patient should be followed over time to know whether exotropia is stable or deteriorating.\n\n\tCongenital Exotropia:\n\n\tIt is characterised by:\n\n\t-\u00a0Fairly large and constant angle of deviation.\n\n\t-\u00a0Since infant uses left eye in left gaze and right eye in right gaze (uncrossed homonymous fixation), development of amblyopia is uncommon.

Deviations usually occur first for distance and later appear for near fixation. However, there are exceptions. The deviation remains constant or rarely may decrease.\n\n\tSensory deprivation exotropia:\n\n\tAn eye with poor vision (may be due to opaque media), or a blind eye drifts outwards into exodeviation. This usually occurs in children 2 to 4 years of age and in adults.\n\n\tConsecutive exotropia:\n\n\tDevelopment of consecutive exotropia, after correction of esotropia, may take many years. Usual factors for surgical overcorrection of esotropia are excessive amount of surgery, amblyopia, high hypermetropia, and poor preoperative evaluation of patient.\n\n\tExotropia should be distinguished from conditions like oculomotor nerve palsy or pseudoexotropia. In pseudoexotropia, visual axis of both eyes is straight, but the eyes appear divergent.", "management":"Nonsurgical methods of correction are adopted in children having good control of deviation as well as in those where risks of overcorrection are undesirable.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Correction of refractive errors: A trial of spectacle correction is given in all cases of refractive errors.

It may decrease the exotropia.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Part time occlusion: Part time occlusion of non deviating normal eye may treat suppression and amblyopia in deviating eye and thereby may correct exotropia and revert it to exophoria. Alternate occlusion of eyes may be done in cases showing equal preference. Part time occlusion has been found useful in very young children.\n\n\t- \u00a0 Use of prisms: Base-in prisms enforce bifoveal stimulation and help in relieving eyestrain. Prisms may be used to improve fusional control.\n\n\t-\u00a0 Orthoptic treatment: Fusional convergence exercises may be employed in patients with symptoms of convergence insufficiency type of intermittent exotropia. Active anti-suppression and diplopia awareness techniques may be used in cases of suppression.

Botulinum toxin injection in extraocular muscles may be used in patients with constant exotropia who are at risk of postoperative diplopia and also who have undergone multiple operations.

 {"id":263, "name":"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)", "intro":"Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)\n\n\tCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by tick-borne virus (Nairovirus). It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.\n\n\tThe disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.\n\n\tThe disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.\n\n\tIn India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012\u20132015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.\n\n\tCCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention.\n\nReferences-\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages\n\n\t\u00a0wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/pdfs/vol21no10\n\nicmr.nic.in/ijmr/2013/December\n\nwww.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/", "symtoms":"Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).\n\n\tThere may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).\n\n\tOther clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums.\n\n\tThere is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness.\n\n\tThe mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness.\n\nReference-\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets", "causes":"CCHF is caused by virus belongs to family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. Since it is enveloped virus, it can be readily inactivated. CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.\n\nVector (living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans) - The common vector of CCHF is the member of Hyalomma genus, the family Ixodidae. These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.\n\n\tCCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.\n\nEnvironmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.\n\nMode of transmission-\n\nAnimal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.\n\nHuman to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.\n\n\tIncubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.\n\n\tThe incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.\n\n\tCCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings.

 {"id":265, "name":"Diabetic Retinopathy", "intro":"Diabetes mellitus is caused due to lack or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin and is characterised by hyperglycaemia.\n\n\tThere are two broad types:\n\n\tType I: This is known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is characterised by insulin deficiency. Usually it has juvenile onset but may occur at any age. Patients are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss.\n\n\tType II: This is known as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity onset diabetes mellitus. It occurs in middle aged/ older people who are often obese. There is impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. Patients may be managed with oral hypoglycaemic agents (drugs which lower blood sugar level). Patients may eventually need insulin especially those with ketonuria or dehydration. This does not mean that IDDM has developed.\n\n\tDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by changes in retinal blood vessels that occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. DR is a retinal microangiopathy affecting arterioles, capillaries and the venules. However, larger vessels may be involved as well.\n\n\tCentral retina or macular area is located between main superior and inferior retinal artery and vein. The area beyond these main vessels is the peripheral retina.\n\n\tRetinopathy has features of both micro-vascular occlusion and micro-vascular leakage of plasma constituents due to breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Micro-vascular occlusion leads to arteriovenous shunts with capillary blockage and neovascularisation (new vessel formation). Micro-vascular leakage may cause haemorrhage and diffuse or localised retinal oedema. This disease can affect vision.\n\n\tDiabetic retinopathy is broadly divided as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Background Diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1225122-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117853-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/117739-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Diabetic_Retinopathy\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10896358\n\n\tKanski,Jack J.

These may be absorbed over a period of time.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal oedema: Retinal oedema is characterised by retinal thickening which obscures underlying layers of retina. Fovea (point of retina through which an object is seen) may assume cystoid appearance due to progressive retinal oedema. Retinal oedema may present as \u2018macular oedema\u2019 or as \u2018clinically significant macular oedema\u2019.\n\n\tMacular oedema: Macular oedema is the presence of retinal thickening or hard exudates within one disc diameter (disc is the point of exit of optic nerve and is 1500\u00b5m in size) of the center of fovea.\n\n\tClinically significant macular oedema (CSMO): This is characterised by the presence of one or more of the following features.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal oedema within 500\u00b5m of the center of fovea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hard exudates within 500\u00b5m of the fovea, associated with adjacent retinal thickening, which may be outside the limit of 500\u00b5m.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Retinal oedema of one disc diameter or larger, any part of which is within one disc diameter of the center of fovea.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tFeatures of Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Retinal changes in Pre-proliferative DR are produced due to ischaemia and consists of:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vascular appearance: Venules show beading, looping or sausage like segmentation.

Over one-quarter of the retina has to be non-perfused before NVD develops. Later, there may be formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in the potential vitreoretinal space.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vitreous detachment or separation: Formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in potential vitreoretinal space may lead to total or partial posterior vitreous detachment. The fibro-vascular tissue may become adherent to posterior vitreous face. Pull on fibro-vascular tissue by the vitreous detachment may lead to haemorrhage in vitreoretinal space or within the vitreous. PDR is asymptomatic until the onset of vitreous haemorrhage.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Haemorrhage: Haemorrhage may occur in potential vitreoretinal space (retrohyaloid space) as pre-retinal haemorrhage or into the vitreous gel (intravitreal haemorrhage).Intravitreal (Intra-gel) haemorrhage takes longer to clear as compared to pre-retinal haemorrhage. Pre-retinal haemorrhage takes crescentic shape along the posterior vitreous detachment.\n\n\tComplications of Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: PDR may lead to retinal detachment, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, rubeosis iridis (formation of new vessels on iris) or formation of opaque membrane on posterior surface of detached vitreous.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tLaboratory tests for Diabetic Retinopathy:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye. Fluorescein Angiography helps in assessing degree of retinal ischaemia and delineates retinal vascular abnormalities. Microaneurysms appear as hyper-fluorescent spots which leaks the dye in late phases of FA. \u2018Blot\u2019 and \u2018Dot\u2019 haemorrhages appear hypo-fluorescent in contrast to micro-aneurysms. Nonperfused areas appear as dark patches or homogeneous hypo-fluorescent areas. NVD and NVE also show leakage of dye on FA. Intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormalities do not leak dye.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT generates cross-sectional image of the retina with light. OCT helps in measuring retinal thickening. Periodic OCT determine whether the retinal thickening in macular area due to oedema is regressing or not with treatment. Any vitreomacular traction can also be assessed.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B-scan ultrasonography: B-scan ultrasonography evaluates retina when the media is not clear e.g. vitreous haemorrhage.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tDiabetic retinopathy should be distinguished from conditions like retinal vein occlusion, retinal vasculitis, sickle cell retinopathy or ocular ischaemic syndrome.", "management":"It should be strictly carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tGoals of management of Diabetes mellitus and Diabetic retinopathy are the good control of disease process and maintaining HbA1c level within a range of 6-7 %.\n\n\tChange in lifestyle with regular exercise helps in controlling Diabetes mellitus which in turn reduces complications including DR.\n\n\tDrug therapy for Diabetes mellitus: Drugs may be from various groups like biguanides, sulfonylureas, meglitinide derivatives, thiazolidinediones, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors or insulin.\n\n\tDrug therapy for Diabetic retinopathy:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intravitreal triamcinolone: Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone may be used in cases of Diabetic macular oedema.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Anti-VEGF): Intravitreal \u00a0injection of Anti-VEGF help in reducing diabetic macular oedema, NVD and NVE. Bevacizumab (Avastin) and Ranibizumab (Lucentis) are VEGF antibodies and antibody fragments (Anti-VEGF) respectively, being used \u00a0as intravitreal injection. Intravitreal Aflibercept (Eylea) may also be given to patients with diabetic macular oedema.\n\nLaser Photocoagulation for Diabetic retinopathy:\n\n\tLaser photocoagulation is a non-invasive technique that has relatively low rate of complication and a significant success rate. Highly focused beam of laser causes coagulation in the target tissue.\n\n\tBackground Diabetic retinopathy: All eyes with CSMO are treated with laser photocoagulation.

 {"id":269, "name":"Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis", "intro":"Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis caused by a group of viruses known as adenoviruses. Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37 are often associated with EKC. Family of adenoviruses contain different serotypes that can also cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. In addition to infections of ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, adenovirus (mainly those responsible for paryngoconjunctival fever) is responsible for causing infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. EKC is reported worldwide and has a tendency to occur in epidemics.\n\n\tMore than half of cases may show symptoms, though milder, in other eye.\n\n\tIt is one of the most common causes of acute conjunctivitis, with clinical features such as sudden onset of acute follicular conjunctivitis, watering of eyes, chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), redness and ipsilateral (same side) pre-auricular (in front of ear) lymphadenopathy.\n\n\tDevelopment of keratitis (corneal inflammation) distinguishes EKC from other forms of conjunctivitis and it usually arises after fourth day of initial onset of symptoms. Corneal involvement ranges from diffuse, fine superficial keratitis to epithelial defects to sub-epithelial infiltrates. Sub-epithelial infiltrates can persist for years, which may cause glare and reduction in visual acuity.\n\n\tEpidemic kerato-conjunctivitis may also develop membranous or pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis in severe cases, which may lead to scarring of conjunctiva and symblepharon (adhesion between eyelid and eyeball) formation.\n\n\tEKC is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. Diagnosis of the disease process is clinical and the treatment is mostly symptomatic. Antiviral and cyclosporine eye drops were tried in some patients, but there was no definite benefit of these. Mild topical steroids may be used in cases with severe membranous conjunctivitis. Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin C (MMC), may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1192751-overview\n\nhttp://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/21109229\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3661494/\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1191370-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Epidemic_Keratoconjunctivitis\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Conjunctivitis\n\nhttp://eyetubeod.com/advancedocularcare/pdfs/aoc1112_cornea_Starr.pdf\n\nHeidelbaugh Joel J, Primary care: Clinics in Office Practice Vol.42, Number 3, September, 2015.

A bone fracture can be the result due to high force impact or stress, or trivial injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture.\n\nClassification:\n\nBy Cause:\n\n\nTraumatic fracture - This is a fracture due to trauma. e.g.- Fractures caused by a fall, road traffic accident, fight and many others\n\nPathological fracture - A fracture of bone due to certain disease that has made bone weak is called pathological fracture. e.g.- a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathological fracture.\n\n\nAll fractures can be broadly described as:\n\n\nClosed (simple) fractures: Are those in which the skin is intact\n\nOpen (compound) fractures: Involve wounds that communicate with the fracture, and may thus expose bone to contamination. Open injuries carry a higher risk of infection.\n\n\nOther types of fracture are:\n\n\nComplete fracture: A fracture in which bone fragments separate completely.\n\nIncomplete fracture: A fracture in which the bone fragments are still partially joined. In such cases, there is a crack in the osseous tissue that does not completely traverse the width of the bone.\n\nLinear fracture: A fracture that is parallel to the bone's long axis.\n\nTransverse fracture: A fracture that is at a right angle to the bone's long axis.\n\nOblique fracture: A fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis.\n\nSpiral fracture: A fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted.\n\nComminuted fracture: A fracture in which the bone has broken into several pieces.\n\nImpacted fracture: A fracture caused when bone fragments are driven into each other.\n\nAvulsion fracture: A fracture where a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/calcium.html\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/fractures.html \nhttp://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00139\nFracture assesment tool by WHO: http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.jsp", "symtoms":"Fractures can cause\n\n\n\t\t\tPain and bleeding\n\n\t\t\tSwelling\n\n\t\t\tBruising or discolored skin around the affected area\n\n\t\t\tThe patient is unable to put weight on the injured area\n\n\t\t\tThe patient cannot move the affected area\n\n\n\t\tIf it is an\u00a0open fracture there may be:\nBleeding\nDamage to adjacent structures such as nerves or vessels, spinal cord and nerve roots (for spine fractures), or cranial contents (for skull fractures) can cause other specific signs and symptoms.\n\nReferences:\nhttp://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00139\nhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000001.htm", "causes":"The fractures are generally caused due to fall with a great impact or road accident.\n\n\t\tHealthy bones are extremely tough and resilient and can withstand powerful impacts.

Bacteria can get in and infect the bone or bone marrow, which may leads to persistent infection (osteomyelitis). Patients may need to be hospitalized and treated with antibiotics.

Milk, cheese, yoghurt and dark green leafy vegetables are good sources of calcium. Our body also needs vitamin D to absorb calcium. By exposing to sunlight, as well as eating eggs and oily fish are good ways of getting vitamin D.\n\nPhysical activity - The more weight-bearing exercises the person does, the stronger and denser their bones will be. Examples include skipping, walking, running, and dancing any exercise where the body pulls on the skeleton. Older age not only results in weaker bones, but often in less physical activity, which further increases the risk of even weaker bones. It is important for people of all ages to stay physically active.\n\nThe (female) menopause - Hormones estrogen, which regulates a woman's calcium, starts to drop and continues to do so until after the menopause. In other words, calcium regulation is much more difficult after the menopause.

This may include:\n\n\n\t\t\tPlaster casts or plastic functional braces - these hold the bone in position until it has healed. Now a days porous casts are used. These porous castes are easy to apply and are not uncomfortable.\n\n\t\t\tMetal plates and screws - current procedures use minimally invasive techniques.\n\n\t\t\tIntra-medullary nails - Internal steel rods are placed down the center of long bones. Flexible wires may be used in children.\n\n\t\t\tExternal fixators - these may be made of metal or carbon fiber; they have steel pins that go into the bone directly through the skin. They are a type of scaffolding outside the body. Usually the fractured bone area is immobilized for between two to eight weeks. The duration depends on which bone is affected and whether there are any complications, such as a blood supply problem or an infection.\n\n\nPain management: Pain killers like ibuprofen, diclofenac is used to relieve pain.\n\nPhysiotherapy: Once the fracture is healed it is necessary to restore muscle strength as well as mobility to the affected area. If the fracture occurred near or through a joint there is a risk of permanent stiffness - the individual may not be able to bend that joint as well as before.\n\nSurgery approach: If there is a damage to the skin and soft tissue around the affected bone or joint, plastic surgery might be required.\n\n\n\t\t\tBone grafting: Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that replaces missing bone in order to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex, pose a major health risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly.\n\n\nReferences:\nhttp://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00139\nhttp://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/173312.php", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

The syndrome is named after the French physicians Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barr\u00e9, who described it in 1916. It is also called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).\n\n\tGBS is an autoimmune disorder in which a person\u2019s own immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement and nerves that transmit feelings of pain, temperature and touch. This leads to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling and sometimes paralysis.\n\n\tMost people recover fully from GBS, but some people have long-term nerve damage. 3%-5% of GBS patients may die from complications, which include paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, blood infection, lung clots or cardiac arrest.\n\n\tThe cause of this condition is unknown, but it\u2019s typically triggered by an infectious illness, such as the gastrointestinal infection or a lung infection. Few countries from Europe and Asia have reported familial occurrence of GBS (42 GBS patients found from 20 families). In a hospital based study from South India among 150 GBS cases reported during 10 years period, 2 cases belonged to a single familya.\n\n\tAccording to WHO overall incidence of GBS is 0.4 to 4.0 people per 100 000 per year.

 {"id":274, "name":"Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis", "intro":"Giant (mechanically induced) Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC), the severe form of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, may be secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. Since GPC is predominantly associated with the use of contact lenses (CLs), the disease is also referred to as contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC).\n\n\tGPC is an inflammatory condition seen in upper tarsal conjunctiva, initially reported by Spring in 1974 (Spring TF, Reaction to hydrophilic lenses, Med J Aust 1974; 1:449-50). A papillary reaction, similar to the one with allergic conjunctivitis, occurs in soft contact lens wearers. Allansmith and colleagues further detailed the syndrome, suggesting that it may be immunologic in origin, with the proteinaceous deposits on the contact lenses, serving as the antigen (Allansmith MR, Korb DR, Greiner JV, et. al. Giant papillary conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers. Am J Ophthalmol 1977; 83:697-708).\n\n\tGPC, a non-infectious inflammatory disorder was originally named for the presence of giant papillae (1.0mm or greater in diameter) along the upper tarsal surface. However, papillae measuring 0.3mm or greater are now considered abnormal and a feature of this condition.\n\n\tGPC is most often associated with wearing soft (hydro-gel) contact lenses, though it can occur with any type of contact lens. The contact lens type, material, wearing schedule, cleaning process and length of time lenses have been worn contribute to the severity of the disease, with soft lens wearers suffering from more severe manifestations of disease than counterparts in rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses. Silicone hydro-gel lenses also appear to have similar effects with prolonged use. Incidence among extended wearers is supposed to be higher than the daily wearers of soft lenses.\n\n\tWith an increased frequency of contact lens replacement from more than four weeks to a period less than that, the incidence of GPC reduces. Both sexes develop GPC. GPC may be more aggressive in children who wear contact lenses.\n\nThe condition has also been reported in patients with:-\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular dermoids.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular prosthesis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exposed sutures/ knots following ocular procedures (such as monofilament nylon sutures).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extruded scleral buckles.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Glaucoma filtering blebs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal surface irregularity.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exposed corneal deposits.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tissue adhesives.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Even elevated corneal scars.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dry eye is a common association, especially with contact lens wearer.\n\n\tA related phenomenon is the so called \u2018mucus fishing syndrome\u2019, when, in a variety of underlying anterior segment disorders, patients develop or exacerbate a chronic papillary reaction due to repetitive manual removal of mucus. Giant papillae can also be seen in other conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC).\n\n\tOne study suggests that patients who suffer from allergies seem to have more severe signs and symptoms of GPC. Significant correlation between GPC and other forms of allergy like rhinitis, hay fever and environmental allergy were found. Giant papillary conjunctivitis can follow seasonality similar to that of environmental allergies.\n\n\tBecause of the high prevalence of GPC in contact lens wearers, every patient who wears contact lens should be considered potential candidate for GPC.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\n\tSaxena S, Clinical Ophthalmology: Medical and Surgical Approach.

This leads to conjunctivitis and further tissue changes and increasing inflammatory markers in the tears.\n\n\tDebris on the surface of contact lenses may be a cause as well as a result, leading to inflammation that causes more lens deposits to form, leading to further inflammation.\n\n\tPoor cleaning, thick or rough contact lens edges, heat sterilisation and extended wearing time favour the development of giant papillary conjunctivitis.\n\n\tFirst-generation silicone hydro-gel contact lenses may be more prone to GPC development, perhaps because of their mechanical stiffness or higher propensity for lipid deposition. Silicone hydro-gel lenses tend to induce more local GPC, whereas soft (hydro-gel) lenses tend to induce more generalised GPC reactions in upper palpebral conjunctiva.\n\nAntigenic factors:\n\n\tIn patients with GPC, there is increase in numbers of inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, plasma cells eosinophils and basophils in conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria. These findings, along with elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also found to be elevated in the tears of GPC patients, with the degree of elevation correlated to the severity of symptoms. With discontinuation of lens wear and resolution of the signs and symptoms, these tear immunoglobulin levels return to normal.\n\n\tThe proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. Even with the best cleaning regimens involving enzymatic treatment, a residual coating still exists, and as new coating material is constantly built on the surface of the lens, the overall lens coating increases. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.\n\n\tThe nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. However, those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposit on GPC-associated contact lenses.\n\nMechanical hypothesis: \n\n\tMechanical hypothesis, is supported by the association between GPC and inert objects, such as cyanoacrylate adhesives, exposed sutures and scleral buckle elements, ocular dermoids and orbital prosthesis. It is postulated that the irritation produced by lens damages conjunctival epithelial cells, and causes release of chemotactic factors (e.g. neutrophil chemotactic factor). It is suggested that a combination of direct trauma and the resulting inflammation cascade can stimulate a hypersensitivity reaction to lens-bound antigens.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of GPC is generally made by thorough history and careful clinical observation.\n\n\tGPC shares morphologic and histologic similarities with VKC, but is best differentiated from this and other immunologically based conjunctival inflammation by the associated clinical history (e.g. contact lens wear, surgical intervention).\n\n\tA careful and selective history is necessary to elicit the reports of symptoms that many may consider normal discomfort associated with contact lens use.\n\n\tA history of systemic allergy also help to predict which of the contact lens users may end up with GPC.\n\n\tSlit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist is required for the diagnosis.\n\n\tThe bio-microscopic finding of normal tarsal conjunctiva, include a vascular arcade of fine, radiating vessels running perpendicular to the lid margin and a smooth, moist and pink surface. This has been termed a \u2018satin\u2019 appearance. Generally, the surface is devoid of papillae, or there may be a fine, fairly uniform papillary appearance detectable after the instillation of fluorescein dye and examination with cobalt-blue filter. These papillae, if present, are often smaller than 0.3 mm in size. Non-specific signs of inflammation, such as thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva with mild hyperaemia, may be noted in early cases. In addition, bulbar conjunctival injection, superior corneal pannus, and corneal opacities may also be found on examination. As the disease progresses, non-uniform papillary changes develop, and finally giant papillae are seen, defined as a papillary reaction greater than 0.3 mm.\n\n\tAllansmith divided superior tarsal surface into three zones. Zone 1 is located proximally along the uppermost edge of tarsal plate, zone 3 is located distally adjacent to the lid margin, with zone 2 in between. Papillae associated with soft contact lens-related GPC first appear in zone 1 and progress to zone 2 and 3.This pattern is reversed in GPC related to rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens wear. Papillae associated with RGP contact lenses are typically seen in zone 3, adjacent to the lid margin or distal half of the lid. These papillae are usually fewer in number and flattened in appearance. The topographic difference between GPC associated with large diameter soft contact lenses and small diameter RGP lenses is most probably related to mechanical or immunological stimulus for GPC. The conjunctiva is affected in sequential manner as the disease progresses. In the early stages, there is hyperaemia of the conjunctiva, with partial loss of the vascular pattern of conjunctiva. The papillae size is around 0.3mm. With progression of the disease there is more congestion of the tarsal surface with loss of vascular pattern. In severe cases, the tarsal plate is thickened with total obscuration of the vascular pattern. This stage may be associated with sub-conjunctival scarring.\n\n\tCharacterisation of the size and location of the papillae is helpful in correlating clinical findings with patient symptoms. Delineation of the upper tarsal plate into three zones, as well as two areas medially and laterally, can be useful to the clinician in determining whether findings are within the normal variance or whether it represents disease. For example, large papillae in the junctional or transitional zone are not considered pathologic and should be disregarded in the assessment of the upper tarsal conjunctiva.\n\n\tBio-microscopic findings may also be helpful, as the location and appearance of the papillae are associated with the type and material of the lens. Soft contact lens wearers often exhibit a generalised papillary response, whereas those wearing rigid gas-permeable lenses or silicone hydro-gels manifest papillae in a more localised fashion. Soft lens wearers usually form papillae nearest the upper margin of the tarsal plate and progress to diffuse involvement, whereas rigid lens wearers and those using silicone hydro-gel lenses develop papillae near the lid margin and persist in a more localised pattern.\n\n\tIn addition, other associated signs and symptoms can aid in the diagnosis of GPC. These signs and symptoms are often classified into four stages:\n\nStage 1, or Preclinical disease: Minimal mucous discharge is usually noted upon awakening, and patients may have occasional itching after lens removal. Examination of the lens reveals a mild protein coating. The tarsal conjunctiva may appear normal, or exhibit mild hyperaemia with normal vascular structures.\n\nStage 2, or Mild disease: \u00a0There is increased mucous production along with itching, increased lens awareness and marked coating of the contact lens. Blurring of vision may occur. Mild to moderate injection of the tarsal conjunctiva is seen with some loss of normal vascular pattern (i.e. superficial vessels are typically obscured, but deeper vessels are still visible). The papillary reaction noted on examination may show variability in terms of the size of the papillae. Some of the papillae measure 0.3 mm or greater at this stage, and can best be detected upon examination with cobalt-blue filter after instillation of fluorescein dye.\n\nStage 3, or Moderate disease: Itching and mucous formation, along with lens coating, are more prominent, and patients often have difficulty with lens tolerance and keeping the lens clean. Increased lens awareness and excessive lens movement with blinking results in fluctuating vision and reduction in lens wear time. The tarsal conjunctiva shows marked thickening and injection, with obscuration of normal vascular pattern. The papillae increases in both size and number, and the papillae appear more elevated secondary to changes in the underlying tissue (e.g. sub-conjunctival fibrosis and thickening).\n\nStage 4, or severe disease: Patients are often unable to wear their lenses at all, with intense discomfort and cloudy vision upon initial insertion of the lens. There is excessive lens movement and poor centration of the contact lens. Increased mucous secretion is also seen, often to the point where the eyelids are stuck together in the morning. The normal vascular pattern is completely obscured, and the papillae have enlarged to size of 1 mm or greater. There may be sub-conjunctival scarring and fluorescein staining of the apices of papillae.\n\n\tIt is important to note that, although these stages can aid in the characterisation of the disease, patient presentation is often variable. Some patients may have minimal complaints but exhibit marked inflammatory changes on the tarsal conjunctiva; in contrast, patients with severe symptoms may present with only mild or early tarsal changes. Also, despite GPC is often noted bilaterally, the clinical findings may be grossly asymmetric. In some cases, the disparity between eyes is easily explained (e.g. poor lens fit), but in other cases, no specific reason is determined.\n\nThus signs of GPC are:\n\n\t- Increased mucous discharge. Increased mucous discharge in GPC is because of increased surface area and thickness of epithelium with a resultant increase in total number of goblet cells. There is also increased mucous secretion by non-goblet epithelial cells.\n\n\t- Substantial CL protein deposits may be present.\n\n\t- Excessive CL mobility due to upper lid capture.\n\n\t- Superior tarsal hyperaemia and papillae; by definition, \u2018giant\u2019 papillae are > 1.0 mm in diameter, but the clinical syndrome of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis commonly features only fine/medium papillae, particularly in early or mild disease.\n\n\t- Focal apical ulceration and whitish scarring may develop on larger papillae.\n\n\t- Ptosis may occur, mainly as a result of irritative spasm and tissue laxity secondary to chronic inflammation.\n\n\tThe pathognomonic sign of disease is papillae formation on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Presence of papillae larger than 0.3 mm in association with presence of the symptoms is diagnostic of GPC.\n\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\n\n\tNeutrophils and lymphocytes are present in the epithelium and substantia propria of normal conjunctival tissue. Mast cells and plasma cells are also present, though they are sequestered to the substantia propria. In patients with GPC, these cells increase in number and are often found throughout the epithelium and the substantia propria, and are found in conjunction with other inflammatory cells, such as basophils and eosinophils. Elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also elevated in the tears of GPC patients.\n\n\tThe proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.\n\n\tThe nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. Those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposits on GPC-associated contact lenses.\n\nGPC should be differentiated from conditions such as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chlamydial genitourinary infections.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Congenital ptosis.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tOther cause of conjunctival papillae should be excluded, as well as CL intolerance due to other causes, such as a reaction to lens cleaning solutions and dry eyes.\n\n\tGPC treatment is directed at reducing or eliminating any mechanical stimulation and lens coating from the contact lenses or modulating the immune response to the antigenic proteins on the lens surface. Depending on the severity of disease, several or all of the strategies for reducing lens coating or mechanical stimulation may need to be employed.\n\n\tThe ultimate goal in managing patients with GPC is to allow them to continue wearing their contact lenses.\n\n\tIndividuals utilising daily disposable lenses have not been reported to develop GPC.\n\n\t\u00a0Removal of the stimulus:\n\n\t- Measures adopted to reduce exposure to the antigenic proteins on the contact lens:\n\n\n\t\tCL wear should be discontinued for several weeks and the current lenses replaced. For mild-moderate disease, this may be adequate for resolution. In severe CLPC a longer interval without lens wear may be needed.\n\n\t\tDecreasing the lens wear time.\n\n\t\tChanging design of the contact lens.\n\n\t\tChanging the lens material.\n\n\t\tShortening contact lens replacement interval.\n\n\n\t- Assessment of the status and fit of an ocular prosthesis.\n\n\t- Replacement of ocular prosthesis by a new prosthesis (preferably coated with bio-compatible material- biocoat).\n\n\t- Removal of other underlying causes, such as exposed sutures or a scleral buckle.\n\n\t- Partial excision, revision with non-penetrating drainage surgery or glaucoma drainage device implantation for filtering bleb.\n\n\t- Cessation of contact lens wear, substituting spectacles or refractive surgery, may be necessary for severe or refractory disease.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nEnsure effective cleaning of CL or ocular prosthesis:\n\n\t- Changing the type of CL solution, particularly discontinuation of preservative-containing preparations. Cleaning, rinsing and storage solutions containing preservatives such as thiomersal and chlorhexidine should be discarded.\n\n\t- Switching to monthly, then daily disposable CL, if the condition persists after renewing non-disposable lenses.\n\n\t- Rigid lenses carry a lesser risk of CLPC, probably because they are easier to clean effectively.\n\n\t- Regular (at least weekly) use of contact lens protein removal tablets (enzyme cleaning).\n\n\t- Ocular prosthesis: Ocular prosthesis should be cleaned with detergent and polished.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\t-\u00a0Cold compresses: Cold compresses help in improving symptoms.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tMedications such as mast cell stabilisers and topical corticosteroids may be needed to control immune reaction.\n\nDrug therapy includes:\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical artificial tears: Artificial tears provide lubrication and help to wash away the environmental allergens and lens debris.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical mast cell stabilisers: Mast cell stabilisers should be non-preserved in patients wearing soft contact lens, or can be instilled when the lenses are not in the eye, with a delay of perhaps half an hour after drop instillation prior to lens insertion. Most can be continued long-term if necessary. Examples are cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast. Cromolyn sodium in early GPC, particularly when combined with meticulous lens hygiene, gives relief of foreign body sensation, dryness, congestion, mucus production and in papillary size.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective, and thus significantly reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action. Topical antihistamine and mast cell stabiliser combination solution may offer a pharmacologic adjunctive treatment. Combined antihistamine/mast cell stabilisers generally suffice without exposing the patient to the known risks of topical corticosteroids. Most patients do not require more aggressive treatment.\n\n\t-\u00a0Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve symptoms. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\n\n\t-\u00a0Topical corticosteroids: Topical steroids like fluorometholone or loteprednol may be used. Topical steroids can be used for the acute phase of resistant cases, particularly those where effective removal of the stimulus is difficult, as in bleb-related disease.\n\n\tShort-term low-potency topical corticosteroid used concurrently with combined antihistamine/mast cell stabiliser (dual-acting drugs) is a more effective treatment than mono-therapy with either separately.\n\n\tThere is no role of long-term usage of topical steroids in treatment due to associated complications (development of cataract, glaucoma or superadded infections).\n\n\t-\u00a0Immune-modulator drugs: Immune-modulator drug such as tacrolimus ointment is found to be comparable to fluorometholone in efficacy without the side effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of GPC. (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/22821643).\n\n\tTopical tacrolimus ointment for severe GPC cases, refractory to conventional therapy, appears to be effective alternative treatment (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/18216583).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tImmune response modulation for GPC mainly focuses on topical therapy, most commonly mast cell stabilisers and loteprednol. Mast cell stabilisers may be used in patients with moderate to severe GPC that suffered a recurrence of symptoms despite changes in the contact lens design or polymer. The use of steroids, such as loteprednol, has been found to reduce the presence of papillae, itching, and lens intolerance. However, chronic treatment with a steroid is generally not recommended in these cases.\n\n\tA combination of the two options seems most appropriate for initiating treatment for the patient suffering from GPC.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nFor stage 1, more frequent observation (e.g. 4-6 month follow-up) may be all that is required, as these individuals are generally asymptomatic but will be predisposed to developing GPC.\n\n\tTreatment for stage 2 to stage 3 should begin with discontinuation of contact lenses for about 2-4 weeks, with re-evaluation of the conjunctiva and refit with frequent replacement of contact lenses. These can range from daily disposables lenses to lenses that are replaced every 2 weeks. For those changing their lenses every 1-2 weeks, a lens cleaning regimen utilising a hydrogen peroxide (disinfection by hydrogen peroxide appears to be least likely to further traumatise the conjunctiva)based cleaner is preferred. If there is return of symptoms despite a change in the lens type and polymer, discontinue the lenses for another 2-4 weeks, refit with a daily disposable lens (or RGP lens) and add a mast cell stabiliser. These patients should generally be re-evaluated 3-4 times in a year.\n\nFor severe, or stage 4 disease, discontinuation of contact lens wear may be required for at least 4 weeks, along with refitting the contact lens with either a daily disposable or RGP lens. Check for the resolution of associated findings of corneal and apical papillary staining. The appearance and size of the papillae may not change during the course of treatment for severe GPC. If the associated inflammatory signs have resolved, then attempts to refit the patient with a new lens may have a greater success rate. If the patient is refitted with a daily wear contact lens and replaces the lens in an interval of 4 weeks or less, the rate of developing GPC reduces.\n\n\tIf there is no response and signs and symptoms persist, one may have to consider discontinuing contact lens use.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\t-\u00a0Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) may be considered in patients who refuse conservative management. This helps in avoiding contact lenses.\n\nTherapeutic effect is evidenced by:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Return of contact lens tolerance.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased mucous in tears.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Suppression of ocular itching.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased hyperaemia of tarsal conjunctiva.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decreased inflammation of giant papillae.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tAmelioration of symptoms is more important than clinical signs in assessment of therapeutic effect.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tOverall prognosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is good. About 80% of patients may return to comfortable contact lens wear with appropriate management.\n\n\tGiant papillary conjunctivitis has been a common cause of temporary and permanent contact lens intolerance.\n\n\tThe eyelids in some patients may return to their normal appearance following resolution of GPC, whereas in others, lid retain small, white-capped scars of giant papillae for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.\n\n\tPatients should be educated about the chronic nature of disease and its clinical symptoms (e.g. Itching of eyes, mucous discharge and contact lens intolerance).

It can be easy not to drink enough fluid if your mouth is painful. Young children with cold sores are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated.\n\nHerpetic whitlow (whitlow finger): Some time the virus may spread to other parts of the body. This is known as a secondary infection. Herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) is a secondary infection of the cold sore virus that causes painful sores and blisters on and around fingers. It can occur when the cold sore virus comes into contact with a cut or graze on your hand and enters the skin. However, herpetic whitlow can be easily treated using antiviral medication.\n\nHerpetic keratoconjunctivitis: Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis is a secondary infection of the cold sore virus that affects the eyes. If the virus comes into contact with eyes, it can cause inflammation (swelling and irritation) of eye area and sores to develop on eyelids. However, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can usually be easily treated using antiviral medication available from a specialist eye doctor. If left untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea (the transparent layer at the front of your eye) to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness.\n\nEncephalitis: Encephalitis is a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen. This can be very serious and it can cause brain damage and even death. In very rare cases, encephalitis can be caused by the virus spreading to the brain.

Malignant hypertension refers to severe hypertension ( more than 200mm of Hg as systolic and more than 130mm of Hg as diastolic) in conjunction with bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates with or without papilloedema.\n\n\tIn hypertensive retinopathy, retinal arterioles (small diameter blood vessels joining arteries to capillaries) respond to systemic hypertension by narrowing. Narrowing depends upon the degree of pre-existent involutional sclerosis (fibrosis). Therefore, hypertensive narrowing in its pure form is seen in young individuals whereas less narrowing is seen in older individuals due to rigidity of vessels (caused by involutional sclerosis). In sustained systemic hypertension, there is vascular leakage due to disruption of blood-retinal barrier.

HPV is one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions a. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract.\n\n\tThe main burden of HPV-related disease is due to cervical cancer. HPV infection is a well-established cause of cervical cancer and a relevant factor in other anogenital cancers (anus, vulva, vagina and penis) and head and neck cancers. HPV is also responsible for other diseases such as recurrent juvenile respiratory papillomatosis (a disease in which tumours grow in the air passages leading from the nose and mouth into the lungs) and genital warts in men and women. Genital warts are very common and highly infectious.\n\n\tCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\tAbout 80% of cancer cases attributable to HPV were in developing countries.\u00a0 The highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.\n\n\tIndia has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of ageb.\n\n\tBased on Indian studies (performing HPV detection tests in cervical samples) about 5.0% of women in the general population are found to carry cervical HPV-16/18 infection at a given time, and 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18.(Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)b.\n\n\tOther epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.\n\n\tIndia also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.\n\n\tHPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for about 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide.

It is antigenically related to other tick-borne flaviviruses and resembling Russian spring\u2013summer (RSS) complex of viruses.\n\nMode of transmission of KFD virus:\n\n\tThe virus is transmitted to humans by bite of infected unfed nymphs*(immature stage of tick). Human to human transmission is not known.\n\nNatural hosts and reservoirs- Small mammals particularly rats and squirrels are main reservoir of the virus. Monkeys act as amplifying hosts for the virus and disseminate the infection, but most of them die from KFD infection. Cattle maintain tick population by providing them blood meal but play no part in virus maintenance. Man is incidental or dead end host, and plays no role in viral transmission.\n\nVectors- Hard Ticks of genus Haemaphysalis transmit the disease. Spinigera species of Haemaphysalis is the main vector of KFD and is commonly found in Karnataka State, India. Humans become infected through the bite of infected unfed nymphs when they pass through the forests. Adult ticks feed on large animals like cattle. These large animals are good hosts for proliferation of ticks but are not significant for virus dissemination due to insignificant viremia (presence of virus in blood) in them. Ticks also transmit this virus transstadially (from one life stage to next) thus also acts as reservoir for the virus.\n\n\t(*Life cycle of hard ticks- Hard ticks have four developmental forms; egg, larva, nymph and adult (female and male). Adult fed female tick lays eggs on the ground, which hatch to larvae under the vegetations. The larvae further infest and feed on small mammals and monkeys, drop on the ground and change into nymphs. Nymphs feed on small mammals, birds, (as well as accidentally infesting humans), drop on the ground and mature in to adults. Adult ticks usually feed and mate on large animals such as cattle, monkeys. Such type of ticks, feeding on three different hosts is called three-host ticks, one each for the larval, nymphal, and adult life stages).\n\nRisk factors-\n\n\n\t\tPeople with occupational or recreational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks.\n\n\t\tIn Karnataka more cases are reported during the dry season, from November to June.

 {"id":282, "name":"Low Vision and VisuaI Aids", "intro":"Vision\u00a0is the special sense by which the qualities of an object (as colour, luminosity, shape, and size) constituting its appearance are perceived through a process in which light rays entering the eye are transformed by the retina(light sensitive inner layer of eyeball) into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve .\n\nVisual acuity\u00a0is a measure of resolution of the visual processing system. It is measured commonly with an eye chart e.g. Snellen chart. \u00a0A common Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. In visual acuity testing on Snellen chart, person normally sits at a distance of 6 meters from the chart on which letters of standard decreasing size are there in rows. Top line has a single letter which should be readable at a distance of 60 meters. Visual acuity is recorded as a ratio with numerator of 6 (distance at which patient sits.) and the denominator of the smallest possible size being read by the patient. For example, a vision record of 6/60 means that patient sitting at 6 meters could read letter in top line only , which should normally be read at 60 meters. Instead of distances being in meters, it may also be measured in feet. 6 meters is about 20 feet. Therefore, a vision of 6/6 in meters, is equivalent to a vision of 20/20 in feet. Similarly, a vision of 6/60 in meters, is equal to 20/200 in feet.\n\n\t\tTypical Snellen chart to estimate visual acuity:\u00a0Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLow vision\u00a0was defined as \u2018Visual acuity of 6/18 down to and including 3/60 in the better eye\u2019. A person with low vision is \u2018someone who, after medical, surgical and/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of \u00a0\u00a0<6/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of\u00a0 \u00a0<20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.\u2019 Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10th\u00a0revision of the International classification of the diseases (ICD-10 version: 2015), the term low vision is replaced by terms\u00a0\u2018moderate\u00a0visual impairment(presenting visual acuity of\u00a0 \u00a0<6/18 to 6/60)\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018severe visual\u00a0impairment\u00a0(presenting visual acuity of \u00a0\u00a0<6/60 to 3/60)\u2019, from all causes.\n\n\t\t\u2018 Vision 2020: the Right\u00a0 to Sight\u2019 is a partnership between World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Agency for the prevention of Blindness(IAPB), had been launched in 1999 with the twin aims of eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and preventing the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment between 1990 and 2020 . VISION 2020 advocates for increased awareness of the need for low vision services. Low vision services are aimed at people who have residual vision that can be used and enhanced by specific aids. A low vision resource centre is operating from Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China, to distribute high quality, affordable low vision devices and equipment to all regions.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.who.int/blindness/Vision2020_report.pdf(link is external)\nwww.aoa.org(link is external)\nwww.kellogg.umich.edu(link is external)\nwww.eschenbach.com(link is external)\nwww.visionaware.org(link is external)\n\t\t\u00a0www.geteyesmart.com(link is external)\n\n\t\tAbrams David.

Though treated surgically, few associated with ocular diseases may benefit with Low vision aids.\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0 In Diabetes, due to hypoxia ( less oxygen supply to retina ), there are vascular changes leading to haemorrhages (bleeding) and exudates ( leaks from vessel ). These changes in Macula may produce diminution of vision.\n\nGlaucoma\u00a0\u2013 In Glaucoma, there is rise in intraocular pressure leading to damage to the optic nerve and diminution of vision.\n\nRetinal Detachment\u00a0\u2013 Retina may separate from its underlying layer and leads to diminution of vision.\n\nRetinitis Pigmentosa\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0 An inherited disease, usually affects peripheral vision to begin with, leads to night blindness.\n\nRetinopathy of Prematurity\u00a0\u2013Retinal vessels are not fully developed in premature infants. Premature infants are kept on oxygen in incubator. There is relative hypoxia in peripheral part of retina, which leads to new vessel formation and other complications, leading to diminution of vision.\n\nOptic Nerve Diseases like Optic Atrophy\n\nHeredomacular degeneration (Stargardt\u2019s disease)\n\nAlbinism\n\nNystagmus\n\nBrain damage\u00a0\u2013 There may be injury or disease of brain which may affect vision", "diagnosis":"Most people requiring visual aids have macular problems.

Similarly, for near vision, special charts indicate reading vision and the magnification or addition required to attain a particular level.\n\n\t\t\t\tVisual fields \u2013 It is done to assess the peripheral vision.", "management":"Many of the patients are old and frequently relatively immobile so that the retention of some ability to read is of vital importance. Low vision aids improve the reading capability and speed of reading. Visual aids for distance are less practical than those for near.\n\n\t\t\tAccurate refraction and appropriate illumination should be ensured for optimal retinal image.\n\n\t\t\tMagnification is the basis of most techniques used in low vision clinic. There are three methods of enlarging the retinal image :-\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBy bringing the object nearer to the eye.\n\n\t\t\t\tBy magnification of the retinal image.\n\n\t\t\t\tBy increasing the size of the object to be viewed.\n\n\n\t\t\tBringing the object nearer to the eye, leads to larger visual angle being subtended at the eye.\n\n\t\t\tMagnification, \u00a0though increases the size of retinal image, leads to diminished visual field and reduced depth of focus. Due to this, lighting should be ample and directed on the fixation area. Therefore, lowest magnification compatible with useful vision should be employed .\n\n\t\t\t\u00a0Low vision aids may be -\n\n\n\t\t\t\tOptical devices, such as magnifiers and telescopes.\n\n\t\t\t\tAdaptive non-optical devices, such as large-print reading material and talking watches.\n\n\t\t\t\tNon-magnifying visual aids.\n\n\t\t\t\tElectronic devices \u00a0-\u00a0 \u00a0computer software.\n\n\nOPTICAL\u00a0 DEVICES\u00a0:-\n\nHand-held Magnifiers\u00a0\u00a0:- \u00a0Hand \u2013 held magnifiers are the simplest type of magnifiers. The hand-held magnifier design involves a handle that is attached to a plus lens through which the user views an object. Since user must support the weight of magnifier, hand-held magnifiers are helpful for short term spotting task, like reading a prescription bottle or a price tag. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers with a variety of lens designs \u00a0e.g. \u00a0aspheric , aplanatic , biconvex , and diffractive lens.\n\nImage in Wikipedia(link is external).\n\nStand Magnifiers\u00a0\u00a0:- Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Stand Magnifiers are good for extended, near tasks such as reading a book, newspaper or magazine and making small notes. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers. There are around-the- neck\u00a0 magnifiers , for jobs which require both hands to be free, like sewing and knitting.\n\n\t\t\tSome magnifiers may use variations like :\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCombination of lenses are also extensively used in magnifiers e.g. Hastings triplet magnifier.\n\n\t\t\t\tStepped lenses introduced by Fresnel can also be used as magnifiers. One type is essentially a plastic sheet with concentric ridges forming a series of prisms of increasing power from the axis to the periphery and has the great advantage of eliminating the thickness and marked aberration that would be unavoidable in a single large lens with a continuous surface.\n\n\nMagnifying Reading Glasses\u00a0:- Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses. These may be having constant power or are progressive to be used for varying reading distances . These may be of illuminated type, which can be used in the dark.\n\nSpectacle Magnifiers\u00a0:-\u00a0 Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have \u2018 hands free\u2019. These may be:\n\n\n\t\t\t\tClip\u2013 on system :- \u00a0To be worn over the glasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tPrismatic eye wear :- \u00a0Prisms are incorporated in spectacle to aid monocular or binocular vision. These may be bifocal, with normal reading power in upper part, and prismatic high power in the lower part for reading fine print.\n\n\t\t\t\tNoves spectacle magnifier :-\u00a0 It uses diffractive lenses which are much thinner than the lenses of similar power.\n\n\t\t\t\tSpectacle microscope magnifiers :- \u00a0Have lenses of greater power than a traditional lens which forms a microscopic system when mounted on a spectacle lens. By holding the object closer, it allows an increase sized \u00a0image with large field of view and clarity.\n\n\nTelescopes\u00a0:-\u00a0 Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance ( near, intermediate or far ) and for any duration of time ( short term or long term ). Telescopes may be monocular or binocular, focusable or fixed-focus, hand-held or spectacle mounted.\n\nTechnical\u00a0 Magnifier\u00a0:-\u00a0 Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers.\n\n\t\t\tHigh power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle. This is called a Loupe. These may be monocular loupe e.g. jewellers\u2019 and watchmakers\u2019 loupes or binocular.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLoupe :\u00a0Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\n\n\t\t\t\tBinocular dental loupes:\u00a0Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\n\n\n\t\t\tAplanatic system of lenses such as exemplified in ophthalmic loupe, diminishes distortion of images.\n\nLamp Magnifiers\u00a0:-\u00a0 Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination. These are good for extended near to intermediate tasks that need both magnification and illumination in a hands-free design.\n\nNON- OPTICAL DEVICES\u00a0:- Increasing the size of the object to be viewed helps in approach to low vision e.g. Large-size telephone bills or large-size print books. The benefits of optical devices, may be enhanced by non-optical means, such as improving light or reducing glare.\n\nFlexible-Arm Task Lamps\u00a0:-\u00a0 Flexible-arm task lamps can be adjusted to a variety of tasks by providing proper light.\n\nFull Spectrum Light Bulbs\u00a0:-\u00a0 Full spectrum light bulbs provide full range of colours found in sunlight, and hence more natural light. A sunscreen may be needed for longer duration of work, just as working out door in sunlight.\n\nAbsorptive Sun lenses/Sun glasses\u00a0:- \u00a0\u00a0Absorptive sun lenses filter out ultraviolet and infrared light. These are helpful in bright light , reduce glare and increase contrast.\n\nColoured Acetate Sheets\u00a0z-\u00a0 Coloured acetate sheets, especially yellow or marigold, when placed on the page, can enhance contrast between the print and background, making words and letters appear darker and easier to read.\n\nNON- MAGNIFYING VISUAL AIDS\u00a0:-\n\nStenopaeic Hole\u00a0:- Stenopaeic hole is useful in any error of refraction or where the transparency of the ocular media is at fault. It is useful to a presbyope to read or write in an emergency.\n\n\t\t\t\u00a0As a stenopaeic slit, it may protect against ultraviolet radiation reflected from the snow.\n\n\t\t\t\u00a0As a reading slit cut in dark cardboard or plastic material, when placed immediately over print, may help patients with early lens opacities. In such cases, reflected light from the page is decreased and the contrast is thereby increased, allowing greater clarity in reading.\n\nELECTRONIC DEVICES\u00a0:-\n\nVideo Magnifiers\u00a0:-\u00a0 Video magnifiers use video cameras to project a magnified image onto a video monitor , a television (TV ) screen, or a computer monitor. Video magnifiers use stand-mounted or hand-held video cameras and are also called \u2018closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems\u2019. Apart from the undistorted magnification, CCTV offers two other advantages. The polarity may be reversed, allowing the print to be offered as white on black, the contrast is found helpful by some patients. It is possible to isolate one line of print, which may make it more intelligible.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHand-held video magnifiers rest against the reading material and generally have a small integrated display. Some hand-held magnifiers can project magnified image on a television.\n\n\t\t\t\tStand-mounted like Desktop video magnifiers have a table surface on which the object is placed. Above the object, is a camera and monitor upon which the magnified image is projected.\n\n\nNewer Technologies\u00a0:-\u00a0 Advances in consumer electronics is improving quality of life for people with low vision. Digital devices and apps offer options for portable, lower-cost low vision aids.\n\nE- readers\u00a0- The iPad and other electronic- readers are portable, and allow the user to adjust the font size and contrast setting. They have text-to-speech functionality and can read aloud to the user. E-readers do not offer the same level of magnification as CCTVs.\n\nSmartphones and Tablets\u00a0\u00a0- \u00a0Both Apple and Android based smartphones and tablets offer a range of apps and built-in functions to help people with low vision.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMagnify, \u00a0iRead and iLoupe use camera of device, and light source to magnify and illuminate text.\n\n\t\t\t\tSightBook app digitally communicate your vision changes to your ophthalmologist by measuring your visual function with a set of near vision tests.\n\n\t\t\t\tMapquest app provides voice-guided directions and tells the driver when to turn.\n\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nLimitations of Low Vision Services\u00a0\u00a0:-\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\t\tProvision of low vision services is generally not favoured by eye-care providers because of the low economic gain.\n\n\t\tThe need for low vision services is often not fully recognised, owing to inadequate data.\n\n\t\tThere is little evidence for the cost-effectiveness of low vision care interventions.\n\n\t\tPersons with low vision are often unaware that they can be helped.\n\n\t\tIn some, there may be lack of encouragement on the part of the tester; in others, there may be poor motivation on the part of the patient.\n\n\t\tSome patient may feel that forcing himself to see may accelerate a deterioration of his condition.\n\n\t\tCommunication and referral between eye-care, special education, rehabilitation and low vision services are often inadequate.\n\n\t\tPlanning for low vision services is inadequate.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

PCOS is common diagnosis in women presenting with infertility.\u00a0 \u00a0The exact prevalence of PCOS is not known as the syndrome is not defined precisely. Prevalence of PCOS is highly variable ranging from 2.2% to 26% globally. In few Asian countries prevalence figures are ranging from 2% to 7.5% in China and 6.3% in Srilanka. There are few studies conducted in India. Studies done in South India and Maharashtra, prevalence of PCOS (by Rotterdam's criteria) were reported as 9.13% and 22.5% (10.7% by Androgen Excess Society criteria) respectively.\n\n\tPCOS was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, described as symptoms complex with amenorrhea, hirsutism, and enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts.\n\n\tPolycystic ovary syndrome causes irregular menstrual cycles, excessive body or facial hair and polycystic ovaries as its main symptoms. Polycystic means \"many cysts,\" and PCOS often causes clusters of small, pearl-sized cysts in the ovaries. The cysts are fluid-filled and contain immature eggs. Women with PCOS produce slightly higher amounts of male hormones known as androgens, which contribute to some of the symptoms of the condition.\n\n\tEarly diagnosis of PCOS is important as it has been linked to an increased risk for developing several medical conditions including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease. PCOS is an emerging health problem during adolescence therefore promotion of healthy lifestyles and early interventions are required to prevent future morbidities.\n\nReferences-\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/\n\nhormone.org/diseases-and-conditions/\n\npcosfoundation.org/what-is-pcos\n\nncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC", "symtoms":"PCOS is a syndrome disease defined by a group of signs (physical findings) and symptoms (patient complaints).Symptoms can vary from woman to woman.

But most experts think that several factors, including genetics, could play a role. Women with PCOS are more likely to have a mother or sister with PCOS.\n\n\tA main underlying problem with PCOS is a hormonal imbalance. In women with PCOS, the ovaries make more androgens than normal. Androgens are male hormones that females also make. High levels of these hormones affect the development and release of eggs from ovary each month (process called ovulation).\n\n\tResearchers also think\u00a0insulin\u00a0may be linked to PCOS. Insulin is a\u00a0hormone\u00a0that controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store.

 {"id":288, "name":"Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis", "intro":"Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases.\n\n\tPAC may not be caused exclusively by seasonal allergens, although they may play a role. PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites, animal dander, moulds, cockroach dust, airborne allergens and cigarette smoke) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. About 79% of patients of PAC may still have seasonal exacerbations and is generally worse in the autumn when exposure to house dust mites, animal dander and fungal allergens is greatest. It is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high.\u00a0 Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.\n\n\tPAC and SAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although PAC and SAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.\n\n\tAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reaction upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by de-granulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). \u00a0\n\n\tPerennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In perennial and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement never occurs. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.\n\n\tPAC and SAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively.\n\nReferences:\n\n\tAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.Textbook of Ophthalmology Volume 1.First Edition.

In contrast, Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, caused by pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens.\n\n\tAcute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC de-granulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.\n\nPathophysiology:\n\n\tBoth PAC and SAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its de-granulation.\n\n\tAn allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to de-granulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.\n\n\tThere are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\n\tHistamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, tearing and stinging sensation, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).\n\n\tMC de-granulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.\n\n\tDe-granulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC de-granulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of PAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.\n\n\tImportant features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergic rhinitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bronchial asthma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atopic dermatitis.\n\n\tPatients with PAC are more likely to also have perennial rhinitis with features of sneezing and nasal discharge.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tSigns and symptoms of PAC (are usually milder and with longer duration) and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.\n\n\tPAC remains self-limited without ocular surface damage and is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to allergens.\n\n\tPAC is less common than SAC and, as patients are chronically exposed to allergen, symptoms and signs occur year-round. The most common triggers are mould spores, animal dander, and dust mites usually found in the household. Patients may also be sensitive to seasonal allergen with a superimposed offender to their symptoms. Because of the prolonged exposure, the conjunctiva may become boggy, chronically red, and irritated. Papillary hypertrophy along the tarsal conjunctival surface may occur with chronic exposure to allergens in PAC. The discharge is whitish but thick, and even stringy.\n\n\tMoulds, house dust, and animal dander participate in the disease process. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.\n\n\tDry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to \u2018wash away\u2019 the allergen is usually compromised.\n\n\tThe most significant symptom in allergic conjunctivitis is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.\n\n\tWithout itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. In these other disorders, itching is usually mild and occasional.\n\nSigns of SAC: \n\n\tSigns on slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination may be:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lid oedema.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mucoid discharge, which may be stringy/ropy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mild papillary reaction.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conjunctival hyperaemia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chemosis may be apparent in the bulbar and lower tarsal conjunctiva, giving to it a \u2018milky\u2019 or pale pink appearance.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dramatic unilateral bulging of the conjunctiva, frequently described as the acute formation of a \u2018bubble\u2019 in the eye, mainly when patients rub their eyes.

Dellen may resolve with the resolution of chemosis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Punctate keratitis may be present rarely.\n\n\t\u00a0Diagnostic procedures:\n\n\tInvestigations are generally not required.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch or prick, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.\n\n\tNormally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with PAC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conjunctival provocation test: Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending allergen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of PAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of PAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as PAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.\n\nPAC should be differentiated from conditions like:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact dermatitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toxic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\tManagement of PAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keeping household clean: Allergens in PAC are usually mould spores, animal dander, dust mites, and are predominantly found in the household. Therefore, carpets must be cleaned, changed or removed, as well as children\u2019s stuffed animals, soft toys, and curtains. The mattress top and sides must also be cleaned and enclosed in plastic bags or other dust mite proof cover. Sheets, pillows and blankets should be washed in hot water (54 degree Celsius). Pillows and the base of the bed must be vacuumed regularly. Pets should be kept out of the bedroom, and the bathroom should be kept clean and dry to inhibit mould growth.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air purifiers: While it is better to stop dust mites at the source, reducing the dust levels in the air could be an adequate strategy.

In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild PAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoidance of eye rubbing. \n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tIt is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.\n\n\tMedical therapy includes:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (\u2018conjunctivitis medicamentosa\u2019) (Spector S & Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134\u2013136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations.\u00a0 Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of PAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of PAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the de-granulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of PAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC de-granulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines.\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating PAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. \u00a0Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Immune-modulators: Immune-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immune-modulator agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of PAC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:\n\n\t(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.\n\n\t(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.\n\n\t(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience adverse effects of medications, or\n\n\t(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPrognosis of PAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"For prevention of PAC, avoidance of the offending allergen is the primary behavioural modification. Specific testing will identify the responsible allergen and help a person to ensure ways to avoid it.\n\n\tContact reactions caused by medications or cosmetics may be prevented by avoidance.\n\n\tReduce amount of allergen exposure by:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keeping household clean: Allergens in PAC are usually mould spores, animal dander, dust mites, and are predominantly found in the household. Therefore, carpets must be cleaned, changed or removed, as well as children\u2019s stuffed animals, soft toys, and curtains. The mattress top and sides must also be cleaned and enclosed in plastic bags or other dust mite proof cover. Sheets, pillows and blankets should be washed in hot water (54 degree Celsius). Pillows and the base of the bed must be vacuumed regularly. Pets should be kept out of the bedroom, and the bathroom should be kept clean and dry to inhibit mould growth.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Using air purifiers: Air purifiers that use High-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tWhile it is better to stop dust mites at the source, reducing the dust levels in the air could be an adequate strategy.", "classification":"", "transmission":"", "treatment":"", "myths":"", "symptomsvoice":"", "Diseasedesciption":""},

Doctor may use a wand-like probe (transducer) to send high-frequency sound waves into neck. These pass through the tissue, creating images on a screen that will show if there is any narrowing or clotting in the arteries leading to brain.\n\n\tThis type of ultrasound scan is sometimes also known as a \"Doppler Scan\" or a \"Duplex Scan\".\u00a0\n\nBrain Angiography\n\n\tThis is done to take images of the blood vessels of the brain.

In addition, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may also be used. This involves an ultrasonic probe which is passed down the food pipe (esophagus), usually under sedation. Because it's directly behind the heart, it produces a clear image of blood clots and other abnormalities that may not get picked up by the transthoracic echocardiogram.\n\nReferences:\n\n\nwww.nhs.uk", "management":"All patients need good supportive care in a stroke unit, looked after by physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, Speech therapists, Occupational therapists with help from Radiologists, Neurosurgeons and others with interest in stroke.\n\nIschemic stroke\n\n\tBlockage of a blood vessel, the root cause of ischemic stroke, can be cleared by injection of \u2018clot-busters\u2019 like t-PA into the patient\u2019s forearm veins, but this is successful only in one third of patients who receive this injection within three hours of start of stroke. \u2018Blood thinner\u2019 (like aspirin) and treatment in stroke unit can be used in most patients.

STIs are of public health concern not only because of their high prevalence worldwide, but also because of their potential to cause serious and permanent complications in infected people who are not treated in a timely and effective way. These complications and sequelae include infertility, fetal wastage, ectopic pregnancy, anogenital cancer and premature death, as well as neonatal and infant infections. In addition STIs are known to facilitate human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).\n\n\tThere are more than 30 different sexually transmissible bacteria, viruses and parasites. The most common conditions they cause are gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, trichomoniasis, chancroid, genital herpes, genital warts, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis B infection.\n\n\tSeveral STIs, particularly HIV and syphilis, can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth, and through blood products and tissue transfer.\n\n\tAccording to World Health Organization (WHO) more than 1 million people acquire a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every day globally. WHO estimates that 500 million new cases of one of four curable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis) occur each year worldwide.\n\n\tSTIs/RTIs (reproductive tract infections) are an important public health problem in India. A community based STI/RTI prevalence study conducted during 2002-03 by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shown that 6% of the adult population in India has one or more STI/RTI. This amounts to occurrence of about 30-35 million episodes of STI/RTI every year in the country.\n\n\t\u00a0A large proportion of new STIs occur amongst adolescents and young adults who may not be aware that they are infected, which can have a negative impact upon their future sexual and reproductive health.\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\n/www.who.int/reproductivehealth\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\nwww.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets\n\nnaco.gov.in/upload/", "symtoms":"The majority of STIs are present without symptoms.

They are age, sex, immune status of the host and the virulence of the organism.\n\n\tAge- women become infected at a younger age than men.\n\n\tSex- women can be more easily infected than men.\n\n\tImmune status- The immune status of the host and virulence of the infective agent affect transmission of STIs. Certain STIs increase the risk of transmission of HIV and which in turn increases the transmission of some STIs and complications of STIs by weakening the immune system.\n\nBehavioural factors: Many behavioural factors may affect the chance of getting an STI. Such behaviours are known as \"risky behaviours\u201d, include the following-\n\n\n\t\t\u00a0changing sexual partners frequently;\n\n\t\t\u00a0having more than one sexual partner;\n\n\t\thaving sex with casual partners, sex workers or their clients;\n\n\t\thaving unprotected\u00a0 sex when either partner has an infection;\n\n\t\t\u00a0having had an STI in the last year\n\n\nSocial factors: A number of social factors link sex and behavioural issues and may affect a person\u2019s risk of getting an STI.\n\n\tOther personal behaviours including skin piercing, use of unsterile needles to give injections or tattoos, use of alcohol may be associated with increased risk of STIs,\n\nPopulation groups which are particularly vulnerable:\n\n\n\t\tsexually active teenage girls;\n\n\t\tsex workers and their clients;\n\n\t\tmen or women who have multiple sexual partners;\n\n\t\tmen or women whose jobs separate them from their regular sex partners for long periods of time, such as long-distance drivers, soldiers and migrant workers;\n\n\t\tMen having sex with men including transgender;\n\n\t\tStreet children, prison inmates.\n\n\nReferences- \n\nnaco.gov.in/upload/2014\n\n/www.who.int/mediacentre\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\nwww.emedicinehealth.com\n\nwww.nichd.nih.gov/health", "diagnosis":"Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections.\n\n\tHowever, in low- and middle-income countries, diagnostic tests are largely unavailable. Where testing is available, it is often expensive and geographically inaccessible; and patients often need to wait a long time (or need to return) to receive results. As a result, follow up can be difficult and care or treatment can be incomplete.\n\n\tThe only inexpensive, rapid blood test currently available for an STI is for syphilis. This test is already used in testing of syphilis in pregnant women during antenatal care.\n\n\tSeveral rapid tests for other STIs are under development and have the potential to improve STI diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.\n\nReferences-\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/\n\nwww.nhp.gov.in/disease/syphilis", "management":"STI case management is the care of a person with an STI-related syndrome or with a positive test for one or more STIs.\n\n\tThe components of case management include: history taking, clinical examination, correct diagnosis, early and effective treatment, advice on sexual behaviour, promotion and/or provision of condoms, partner notification and treatment, case reporting and clinical follow-up as appropriate. Thus, effective case management consists not only of antimicrobial therapy to obtain cure and reduce infectivity, but also comprehensive consideration and care of the patient\u2019s reproductive health.STI case management consists of:\n\n(a) Syndromic Management-WHO has recommended syndromic management, which is based on the identification of consistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized signs (syndromes) to guide treatment, without the use of laboratory tests.\n\n\tThis approach allows health workers to diagnose a specific infection on the basis of observed syndromes. Syndromic management is simple, assures rapid, same-day treatment, and avoids expensive or unavailable diagnostic tests. However, this approach misses the majority of STIs that do not demonstrate any syndromes. Flowcharts are used for the management of each syndrome provided as \u201cNational Guidelines on Prevention, Management and Control of Reproductive Tract Infections and Sexually Transmitted Infections\u201d 2014 by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India*. These national standardized treatment protocols for STIs help to ensure that all patients receive adequate treatment at all levels of health care services.\n\n\tEffective treatment is currently available for several STIs.\n\n\t\u2022 Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are generally curable with existing, effective single dose regimens of antibiotics.\n\n\t\u00a0\u2022 For herpes and HIV, antiviral drugs are available that can modulate the course of the disease, though they cannot cure the disease.\n\n\t\u00a0\u2022 For hepatitis B, immune system modulators (interferon) and antiviral medications can help to fight the virus and slow damage to the liver.\n\n(b) Education and Counselling- Counselling is defined here as an interactive confidential process in which a care provider helps a patient to discuss on issues associated with STIs and to explore possible lines of action. Issues that should be addressed in a counselling session include:\n\n\n\t\tEducate the patient on his/her present STI and how it was acquired. Inform the patient that bacterial STIs are curable, viral STIs may recur, and the effects of not taking treatment properly. (Patients with recurrent genital herpes and recurrent vulvovaginitis are usually very distressed and need repeated counselling sessions).\n\n\t\tInform the partner(s) or spouse about the STI diagnosis.\n\n\t\tAssess the patient\u2019s risk for HIV and deciding whether or not to undergo testing for HIV.\n\n\t\tHelp the patient to learn about complications of STIs, such as infertility and congenital syphilis. \u00a0\n\n\t\tInform the patient on how to deal with an incurable STI, such as herpes genitalis or genital warts, which may be transmitted to the partner (s) or spouse.\n\n\t\tEducate the patient on how to prevent future infections, including strategies for discussing and introducing condom use with the partner (s) or spouse.\n\n\t\tTell the patient about confidentiality, disclosure and the risk of violence or stigmatizing reactions from spouse, partner(s), family or friends and ways to overcome these.\n\n\t\tEnable patients to take control of their own life and their responsibilities for disease prevention.\n\n\n(c) Manage and treat partner -Management of sexual partners is based on knowledge of the index patient\u2019s diagnosis (syndromic or specific). The following three strategies can be adopted for the treatment of partners:\n\n\n\t\tOffer immediate epidemiological treatment (treatment based solely on the diagnosis of the index patient) without any laboratory investigation.\n\n\t\tOffer immediate epidemiological treatment, but obtain specimens for subsequent laboratory confirmation.\n\n\t\tDelay treatment until the results of definitive laboratory tests are available.\n\n\n\tWHO recommends that epidemiological treatment (with the same treatment regimen used for the index patient) should be given to all sexual partners.\n\n(d) Offer HIV Counselling and testing- A consultation for an STI is a unique opportunity to provide education on the prevention of HIV and STIs to people who, by definition, are at risk for these infections.\n\n(e) Follow up-Appropriate clinical follow up is a part of comprehensive case management of STI. The follow up schedules are prescribed for each syndrome in the respective flow charts (as provided by GOI*). Patients should be advised to return if their symptoms get worse or persist after the prescribed period of therapy.\n\nReferences-\n\nnaco.gov.in/upload/2014\u00a0*\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream\n\napps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/", "complications":"Consequences of STIs:\n\n\n\t\tSTIs can have serious consequences not only on physical health, but also on the psychological and social well-being of those infected.\n\n\t\t\u00a0If STIs were left untreated, both chlamydia and gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in females, which can cause infertility and ectopic pregnancies.\n\n\t\tGonococcal and chlamydial infection can cause epididymitis and infertility in men.\n\n\t\tMother-to-child transmission of STIs during pregnancy and childbirth can result in stillbirth, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities.\n\n\t\tHPV infection causes cervical cancer.\n\n\t\tInfection with STIs can also increase the risk of acquiring infection with HIV.

 {"id":293, "name":"Shaken Baby Syndrome", "intro":"Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a violent act of one form of child abuse, a non-accidental traumatic brain injury, which can cause neurologic, cognitive and other functional deficits. Retinal findings may be the only manifestation of SBS and then an eye specialist may initially recognise it. Cases should be thoroughly reviewed and prevention strategies developed to prevent further incidents. SBS has important medico-legal implications since the safety of child may be at stake.\n\n\tMaltreatment of children, including non-accidental trauma, is problematic for children, families and care providers. Death may result in most serious cases due to maltreatment. SBS victims can present with wide range of symptoms, from generalised flu- like symptoms to unresponsiveness with risk of imminent death.\n\n\tSigns of maltreatment may not be obvious. Detecting maltreatment requires careful attention of health care providers to ensure safety and care of victim, appropriate counselling of family, reporting of incidents to law enforcing agencies and prevention of repeat occurrences.\n\n\tIn 1946, Caffey described \u2018whiplash shaken-baby syndrome\u2019, a cluster of infantile subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage, traction-type metaphyseal (wide portion or growth plate between epiphysis and narrow diaphysis) fracture, and retinal haemorrhage. This cluster of injuries was noted in many infants despite the lack of any external surface injury. Injuries were attributed to the developmental differences in infants head as compared with adults. Head comprises 25% of the total body weight in infants as compared to about 10% of total body weight in adults. In addition, infants have weak neck muscles, higher water content in brain matter and poor motor control rendering them more susceptible to injury through violent shaking.\n\n\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/515880\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1176849-overview\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/344973-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Shaken_Baby_Syndrome\n\n\tCaffey J.

Serious injuries in infants, notably those causing death, are rarely accidental unless there is a clear cause for the injuries, such as road traffic accident due to motor vehicle.\n\n\tThe majority of all cases of SBS are limited to children under three years of age. Shaking is generally attributed to the perpetrators level of tension and frustration, often generated by infants crying or irritability.\n\nRisk factors for non-accidental injuries include:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Young parents.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unstable family environment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Low socioeconomic status.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unrealistic child-rearing expectations.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Infant prematurity or disability.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rigid attitudes and impulsivity.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Feelings of inadequacy, isolation or depression.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Negative childhood experiences including neglect or abuse.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Crying of the infant or child may also play a role.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tAdditionally, parents or caretakers who have been involved in substance abuse and/or domestic violence may be at a higher risk for inflicting SBS. General demonstration of violence on television, radio and video games may also have a strong correlation with child abuse.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tParents may not be aware of the basic needs and normal development of their infant. Parents may have unrealistic expectations of the infant and a poor understanding of infant\u2019s developmental level and abilities. According to Fulton, infants can spend up to 20% of their waking time crying. To the parents and caretakers, infant may seem inconsolable, and frustration can quickly build up. This may lead to physical shaking of infant in an attempt to calm the baby. Episodes of shaking are directly proportional to the degree of frustration felt by the parent or caretaker, and they become the perpetrators of abuse resulting in child fatality.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tRisk factors of caretakers including babysitters, contributing to SBS, include their immaturity, young age and lack of life experience.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSituations suggesting possibility of abuse are:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Infant presenting with a history that is not plausible or consistent.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presence of new adult partner in home.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Delay in seeking medical attention.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Absence of primary caretaker at the onset of injury or illness.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Previous history or suspicion of abuse.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unexplained changes in neurological status.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unexplained shock and/ or cardiovascular collapse.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Physical evidence of multiple injuries at varying stages of healing.\n\n\tDuring shaking episode, rotational forces and differential movement of the brain in relation to surrounding tissues can tear the bridging vessels resulting in subdural haematoma. In addition, rotational forces lead to strains on the nerve axons in brain resulting in diffuse axonal injury. Head trauma seems to trigger a chain of events that result in cerebral hypoxia, cerebral oedema, raised intracranial pressure and vaso-occlusion. Displacing effect of subdural haematoma may lead to further ischaemia. In general, intracranial injury in absence of any significant accidental trauma is a significant indicator of inflicted injury.\n\n\tCervical spine epidural haematoma may take place in a significant proportion of abused infants, in addition to focal axonal injury of lower brainstem, superior spinal cord and spinal nerve roots. It is also thought that the effect of stretching at cranio-cervical junction during violent shaking may lead to apnoea, which causes diffuse hypoxia.\n\n\tMechanism of injury resulting in retinal haemorrhage is not conclusively known. Several mechanisms for retinal haemorrhages have been postulated such as acceleration-deceleration forces which cause damage via vitreo-macular traction. Other possible mechanisms include blunt head trauma, increased intracranial pressure due to trauma, sudden rise in intraocular pressure, hypoxia, extravasation of subarachnoid blood or coagulopathies.\n\n\tThe number, location, size and character of retinal haemorrhages varies from case to case, however, more severe haemorrhage may be associated with more serious brain injury.", "diagnosis":"The onset of symptoms is useful both in understanding prognosis as well as determining a cause. Timing can best be established by the history, clinical course and results of diagnostic imaging studies. When accurate, the clinical history is the most precise means for establishing a timeline. Elapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies.\n\n\tThe basis for the diagnosis of inflicted injury is a physical examination that conflicts with the history provided.\n\n\tThree categories are identified for parent or caretaker explanations of infant injuries:-\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 First category: First category include explanations of the child not being well including general malaise, fever, nausea, \u00a0vomiting, having a fall or being dropped.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Second category: Second category include explanations such as dangerous use of household objects, including appliances and toys, rough play, or no explanation of the events leading to injury. Over the time, parent or caretaker may or may not offer an explanation and may have used the time to construct a fictitious reason.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Third category: Third category admits of shaking the infant. Very few caretakers do admit shaking, however, when they do, they often cite a history of attempting to console the child or prevent from choking on an object. Two to three explanations or stories are not uncommon.\n\n\tOne of the hallmark presentations of SBS is lack of external injuries. This may lead to a missed diagnosis even in most severe of the cases. Lack of obvious trauma may falsely minimise healthcare provider suspicion of possible maltreatment. In the event, any external injury is noted, it should be fully documented.\n\n\tRepeated physical examinations may reveal further signs of trauma.\n\n\tEvidence of other injuries including non-specific bruises, rib fractures, fractures of long bones, abdominal injuries and retinal haemorrhages should be assessed and documented. Forensic photography can aid in clear and accurate documentation of injuries.\n\n\tAn accurate diagnosis of retinal haemorrhage is crucial for appropriate medical care and for legal reasons.\n\nClinical features:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ocular (eye) manifestations: A child with classic features of physical abuse should have detailed examination of eyes by an eye-specialist.\u00a0 A child may have signs such as:-\n\nPeriorbital trauma: Periorbital trauma like ecchymosis, lid oedema or orbital fractures.\n\nAnterior segment trauma: Anterior segment trauma may show hyphaema (blood in anterior chamber of eye), iris prolapse, corneal laceration or cataract.\n\nPosterior segment trauma: Posterior segment trauma may show vitreous haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage, retinal detachment or avulsion of optic nerve. Macular retinoschisis (splitting of retina) may also occur.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tIt is somewhat controversial whether retinal haemorrhage in a child is a definitive sign of SBS. It is seen that large retinal haemorrhages are unusual in other forms of head injuries and are found in about 1% of cases with serious head trauma.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tRetinal haemorrhages can be seen as early as 48 hours before any intracranial lesions can be found on CT scan or MRI of the brain.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tRetinal haemorrhages are the cardinal manifestations of SBS which may be seen in 75-90% of cases. Classically, children have multilayered retinal haemorrhages i.e. pre-retinal, intra-retinal and sub-retinal. Retinal haemorrhages are too numerous to count and extend from posterior pole to the retinal periphery.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tShaking can lead to permanent vision impairment and may be even blindness in more severe cases.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tThere may be associated brain injury which may result in nystagmus (persistent, involuntary and repetitive to-and-fro movement of eyes), cortical (cortex of brain) blindness or cranial nerve palsies.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Intracranial injury: The important diagnostic feature of SBS is the presence of intracranial injury in an infant. The most common injury is subdural haematoma. Other injuries may be epidural haematoma or subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Traumatic brain injury (TBI): TBI occur when a sudden trauma, such as violent shaking, causes shearing injuries of the brain parenchyma. Clinical features of TBI can range from mild to severe, depending upon the extent of injury to the brain.\n\nMild signs are:-\n\n\t-Headache.\n\n\t-Lethargy.\n\n\t-Dizziness.\n\n\t-Confusion.\n\n\t-Blurred vision.\n\n\t-Changes in mood and memory.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSevere signs are:-\n\n\t-Nausea and vomiting.\n\n\t-Inability to arouse from sleep.\n\n\t-Seizures.\n\n\t-Dilatation of one or both pupils.\n\n\t-Loss of coordination.\n\n\t-Persistent crying.\n\n\t-Refusal to nurse or eat.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bone fractures: Bone fractures can be found in half of all SBS cases, in spite of no apparent external injury. These fractures may take place anywhere in the body. Most common type of bony injury in SBS is the metaphyseal chip fracture. These fractures occur at the growth plate of bone due to uncontrolled swinging of extremities during shaking period. There may be rib fractures as well. In fatal cases, ribs are the most common site for fractures. In addition, whenever an infant presents with rib fractures, it is most often as a result of physical abuse. Posterior rib fractures are often due to antero-posterior thoracic compression such as that associated with a shaking episode.\n\nDiagnostic procedures:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Radiological examination: Skeletal survey should include radiographs of hands, feet, long bones, skull, spine and ribs. This should be performed as soon as general condition of the child permits. Diagnostic yield of radiographs is further enhanced by follow-up skeletal survey conducted after two weeks.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scintigraphy: Scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine test which detects areas of increased or decreased bone metabolism, thus increase sensitivity of detecting rib fractures. Scintigraphy is of particular use if the child has to be discharged to a potentially unsafe environment, prior to two week follow up skeletal survey.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Computed tomography (CT scan): CT scan has primary role in imaging evaluation of a child with TBI. CT scan can detect injuries requiring immediate attention. Initial CT scan should be performed without contrast and is the procedure of choice for demonstrating acute haemorrhage, including that involving subarachnoid space. CT scan should be repeated after a period of time or if there is rapid change in neurologic signs.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI optimizes detection and assessment of intracranial injury including parenchymal haemorrhage, contusions, oedema and shearing injuries. MRI is also sensitive for detecting significant spinal injury and any parenchymal haemorrhage. A posterior, intra-hemispheric subdural haematoma, in the absence of significant accidental trauma, is indicative of inflicted injury.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tElapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies such as CT scan and MRI.\n\n\t(http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/344973-overview#a2).\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spinal tap: If a spinal tap yields bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fluid which is xanthochromic (yellowish appearance of CSF) should arouse suspicion that the cerebral trauma may be several hours old and the blood in CSF is not from traumatic spinal tap.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tLaboratory studies for SBS are nonspecific and are not diagnostic. Leukocytosis is seen in about 50% of cases. Serum chemistry findings are usually normal, but it may reveal evidence of acidosis.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSBS should be distinguished from conditions like:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Accidental head trauma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blunt ocular trauma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Purtscher\u2019s retinopathy: Purtscher\u2019s retinopathy is a haemorrhagic and vaso-occlusive vasculopathy which shows multiple white retinal patches and retinal haemorrhages associated with severe visual loss. It may be associated with traumatic injury, primarily blunt thoracic trauma and head trauma, and numerous non-traumatic diseases.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Terson syndrome: Terson syndrome is the association of intra-retinal haemorrhage with subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anaemia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coagulopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal birth of baby: After normal vaginal delivery, retinal haemorrhages are occasionally seen without any intracranial lesions. Haemorrhages appear to be related to obstetrical and perinatal changes. These can occur with any type of delivery but are more common with normal vaginal or vacuum assisted deliveries.", "management":"Management should be strictly under medical supervision.\n\n\tThe identification, investigation, management and prevention of SBS require a multidisciplinary approach. There is a need for united effort among healthcare, child welfare, law enforcement, social services, education professionals and community at large.\n\n\tAll individuals and groups involved with detection, management and prevention should be provided knowledge of SBS. Creative preventive interventions, education regarding hazards of shaking and the development of appropriate coping skills can be disseminated to the community. The future well-being of children who have been victim to, or have the potential to become a victim of SBS, rests with the ability to work collectively.\n\n\tFinal outcome from inflicted injury is generally worse than accidental injury. Therefore, one must have a heightened index of suspicion for recognising patterns of injury of SBS. Although cause of injury may vary greatly, there are no differences in actual management of non-accidental versus accidental cases.\n\n\tIn suspected SBS, health providers should notify child protective services and law enforcement officials. Prompt notification facilitates a thorough investigation before the medical history becomes blurred by time. Early involvement of child protective services is also important for protection of other children under the custody of same caretakers.\n\nMedical care:\n\n\tIn addition to diagnostic team having specialists from various disciplines, treatment team should have health care practitioners who can resuscitate and stabilise the victim immediately.

 {"id":294, "name":"Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis", "intro":"Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) or \u2018hay fever eyes\u2019 is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to seasonal allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high. In contrast, PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites and animal dander) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.\n\n\tSAC and PAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although SAC and PAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.\n\n\tThe seasonal incidence of SAC is closely related to the cycles of released plant-derived airborne allergens, or aeroallergens. The allergens that produce SAC vary from one geographic area to another, but tree, grass and ragweed pollens are the most common encountered allergens.\n\n\tAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reactions upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). There is evidence suggestive of an element of type IV hypersensitivity in some form.\n\n\tSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.\n\n\tSAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\n\tAgarwal Sunita, Agarwal Athiya, Apple David J, Buratto Lucio, Alio Jorge L, Pandey Suresh K and Agarwal Amar.Textbook of Ophthalmology Volume 1.First Edition.

The most frequent allergens are pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time. In spring, the predominant airborne allergen is tree pollen; in summer, it is grass pollen; and in fall, it is weed pollen. Typically, persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens. In contrast, PAC causes symptoms throughout the year, generally worse in the autumn when exposure to animal dander, house dust mites and fungal allergens is highest. PAC is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form.\n\n\tSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis can manifest itself through tear-film instability and symptoms of eye discomfort during the pollen season.\n\nPathophysiology:\n\n\tBoth SAC and PAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its degranulation. The number of MCs present within conjunctival stroma may be increased up to 60% in patients with SAC as compared to normal.\n\n\tAn allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to degranulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.\n\n\tThere are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n\n\tHistamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, and stinging sensation and tearing, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).\n\n\tMC degranulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.\n\n\tDegranulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC degranulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of SAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.\n\n\tImportant features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergic rhinitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bronchial asthma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atopic dermatitis.\n\n\tSigns and symptoms of SAC and PAC are essentially the same and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.\n\n\tSAC remains self-limited without compromising cornea or ocular surface damage. SAC is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to seasonal allergens.\n\n\tIndividuals with SAC typically have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, usually of short duration, that is, when the predominant airborne allergen is present. Typically, person with SAC are symptom-free during the winter months in cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of some allergens, such as pollen. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.\n\n\tDry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to \u2018wash away\u2019 the allergen is usually compromised.\n\n\tThe most significant symptom in SAC is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.\n\n\tWithout itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of SAC is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. In these other disorders, itching is usually mild and occasional.\n\n\tOcular symptoms of SAC may be associated with features of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing and nasal discharge.\n\nSigns of SAC: \n\n\tSigns on slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination may be:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lid oedema.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mucoid discharge.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mild papillary reaction.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conjunctival hyperaemia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chemosis may be apparent in the bulbar and lower tarsal conjunctiva, giving to it a \u2018milky\u2019 or pale pink appearance.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dramatic unilateral bulging of the conjunctiva, frequently described as the acute formation of a \u2018bubble\u2019 in the eye, mainly when patients rub their eyes.

The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Normally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy. \u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with SAC. Tear and serum levels of IgE may be helpful in diagnosis, monitoring the level of allergic activity and the response to therapeutic measures.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Conjunctival provocation test (CPT): Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending pollen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of SAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of SAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as SAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tear film mediators: Quantitative analysis of tear film inflammatory mediators is used as a disease marker and to understand immune mechanisms.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nSAC should be differentiated from conditions like:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or Dry eye syndrome: KCS may present with conjunctival congestion and ocular irritation but no chemosis and itching is mild. In KCS, conjunctival congestion and punctate keratopathy are seen typically in inter-palpebral area.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Contact dermatitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toxic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blepharitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis: Early viral conjunctivitis may be differentiated from allergic conjunctivitis by history of chronicity and presence of pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Occult foreign body: An occult foreign body beneath the upper lid may cause symptoms similar to allergic conjunctivitis. There is linear staining of cornea due to abrasion produced by foreign body.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tItching is a significant feature of SAC, but it is usually mild and occasional in other conditions.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tOne important goal of treatment is to prevent transformation of SAC to a chronic inflammatory process.\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\tManagement of SAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoid outside activities: Because SAC usually involves allergens, patient should avoid outside activities until late afternoon or after a heavy rain, when pollen levels are lower. SAC tends to be worse in warm, dry weather and to lessen with rain and cool temperatures. Patients should also keep windows in their home and car closed to lessen exposure to pollen.\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Pollen can also be transported indoors on people and pets. Hair and clothes should be washed after being outdoors.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wearing glasses or goggles: Wearing glasses or goggles can also serve as a barrier to allergens.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air purifiers: Air purifiers that use high-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).\n\nSupportive measures:\n\n\tSupportive measures include:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cold compresses: Cold compresses decrease ocular inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Saline solutions: Irrigation of ocular surface with saline solution facilitates removal of allergens, and thus achieves the primary principle of allergy management by minimising exposure of the ocular surface to allergens.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears may be used to wash or dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators away from the ocular surface. In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild SAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoidance of eye rubbing. \n\nMedical therapy:\n\n\tIt is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.\n\n\tMedical therapy includes:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (\u2018conjunctivitis medicamentosa\u2019) (Spector S & Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134\u2013136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations.\u00a0 Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of SAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of SAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the degranulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of SAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC degranulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines. \u00a0\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins (thus relieves itching) and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating SAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. \u00a0Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Immuno-modulators: Immuno-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immuno-modulatory agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of SAC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:\n\n\t(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.\n\n\t(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.\n\n\t(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Experience adverse effects of medications, or\n\n\t(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tPrognosis of SAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss.", "complications":"", "Prevention":"Prevention involves avoidance of the offending allergen is the primary behavioural modification.

Long-term sequlae of trachoma in adults relate to their exposure to active trachoma when they were young. \u00a0Repeat infection by this organism leads to conjunctival inflammation, scarring, trichiasis and blinding corneal opacification.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1202088-overview\n\nhttp://eyewiki.org/Trachoma\n\nwww.who.int/blindness/causes/trachoma/en/\n\nNema H V, Nema Nitin, Textbook of Ophthalmology, Sixth Edition.

Chlamydiae are gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria. The incubation period for trachoma is 5-12 days.\n\n\tChlamydia trachomatis causes trachoma and also genital infections (serotypes D to K) and disease Lymphogranuloma venereum (serotypes L1 to L3). Infection with genital serotypes D to K can cause isolated episodes of Ophthalmia neonatorum in infants or inclusion conjunctivitis in adults. Genital serotypes do not cause trachoma blindness since they do not enter stable transmission cycles within communities. Serotypes D to K occasionally cause sub-acute follicular conjunctivitis but conjunctival scarring is rare.\n\n\tTwo phases, active and cicatricial (scarring) exists for the disease process.\n\n\tActive trachoma occurs most commonly in preschool children, with the highest prevalence in children aged 3-5 years.\n\n\tCicatricial trachoma is most common in middle-aged people. The age group in which cicatricial disease begins to appear depends on the intensity of its transmission in the community.\n\nRisk factors for active trachoma:\n\nIndividual-level risk factors:-\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Having siblings with active disease.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dirty face which attract flies.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Crowded sleeping arrangement enables exchange of secretions.\n\nCommunity-level risk factors:-\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Inadequate water access for personal hygiene.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Limited toilet facilities and poor sanitation leads to increased faecal contamination of the environment which provides a breeding ground for flies.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Control of flies.\n\n\tRecurrent episode of active trachoma infection leads to blindness. Initial infection is confined to conjunctival epithelium and triggers an immune response. Repeat infection with subsequent inflammatory response results in tissue destruction, scarring, contraction and buckling of tarsal plate of upper lid, leading to cicatricial entropion and trichiasis, and corneal opacification by lashes rubbing against it.", "diagnosis":"Diagnosis of trachoma mainly depends upon clinical presentation.\n\n\tMost patients with active trachoma are relatively asymptomatic. Active phase resembles many other diseases in which follicular conjunctivitis is a feature.\n\n\tThe cicatricial phase has unique clinical features, which helps in diagnosing trachoma. Conjunctival scarring alone tends to be asymptomatic, though the associated disturbance of tear film (produced by scarring of mucous and serous glands) often leads to dry eye. Trichiasis causes foreign body sensation as well as blepharospasm. Constant rubbing of eyelashes may lead to corneal opacification and impairment of vision.\n\nWHO grading and clinical features of trachoma:\n\n\tSlit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist is required for grading.\n\n\tActive trachoma is characterised by muco-purulent keratoconjunctivitis. Conjunctival surface of upper eyelid develops follicular and inflammatory response. Cornea may have limbal follicles, pannus (superior neovascularisation of cornea) formation and punctate keratitis. Other extra-ocular mucous membranes like nasopharynx may be involved leading to nasal discharge.\n\nFollicular Trachoma (TF):\n\n\tFollicular trachoma is defined as the presence of 5 or more follicles at least 0.5 mm in diameter in the central part of upper tarsal conjunctiva.\n\n\tFollicular trachoma indicates active disease. This form is most commonly found in children, with peak prevalence in those aged 3-5 years of age.\n\n\tFollicles are germinal centers that primarily consist of lymphocytes and monocytes. Involution of follicles at limbus (corneoscleral junction) gives rise to pathognomonic lesion of past trachoma in the form of Herbert pits.\n\nIntense inflammatory trachoma (TI):\n\n\tIntense inflammatory trachoma is defined as pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than one half of the normal deep tarsal vessels.\n\n\tIntense inflammatory trachoma also indicates active disease. Thin tarsal conjunctiva develops a velvety thickening. Papillae may also be visible. Intense inflammatory trachoma indicates increased potential for significant conjunctival scarring and corneal opacification.\n\nTrachomatous scarring (TS):\n\n\tTrachomatous scarring is defined as the presence of easily visible scars in tarsal conjunctiva. Upper tarsal conjunctiva may show scarring as Arlt\u2019s line.\n\n\tTrachomatous scarring indicates past inflammatory disease and a risk of trichiasis. Severe the scarring, higher is the risk of subsequent trichiasis.\n\n\tThis form may be associated with the development of dry eye syndrome, but chronic low-grade bacterial conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis (inflammation of lacrimal sac) may lead to watering of eyes.\n\nTrichiasis (TT):\n\n\tTrachomatous trichiasis is defined as the presence of at least one eyelash rubbing on the eyeball or there is evidence of recent removal of in-turned eyelashes.\n\n\tThis is a potentially blinding lesion that can lead to corneal opacification.\n\n\tTrichiasis is due to subconjunctival fibrosis over the tarsal plate which leads to distortion of lid.\n\n\tSuccessful correction of trichiasis may help in restoring some vision.\n\nCorneal Opacity (CO):\n\n\tCorneal opacity is defined as easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil that is so dense that at least part of the pupillary margin is blurred, when viewed through the opacity.\n\n\tCorneal opacity reflects the prevalence of visual loss and blindness resulting from trachoma.\n\n\tThis condition includes pannus, epithelial vascularisation and infiltration only if it involves central cornea.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis:\n\n\tIn endemic regions, diagnosis is almost always based on clinical features.\n\n\tLaboratory investigations are mainly used in research.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs): Nucleic acid amplification test is the best laboratory technique, of which polymerase chain reaction is an example.\n\n\tNAATs have high sensitivity and specificity but are expensive and not widely available.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay: Direct fluorescent antibody assay of conjunctival smears is less sensitive than NAATs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): Enzyme immunoassay of conjunctival smears is also less sensitive than NAATs.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cell culture: Cell culture has high specificity but only moderate sensitivity. Cell culture requires a highly specialised laboratory and is expensive. Newer diagnostic methods have superseded cell culture.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intracytoplasmic inclusions. This test is highly specific but has low sensitivity.\n\nHistopathological features:\n\n\tTrachomatous inflammation is characterised predominantly by lymphocytic and monocytic infiltrate with plasma cells and macrophages in follicles. Follicles have typical germinal centers with islands of B-cells proliferation, surrounded by number of T-cells.\n\n\tWith inflammation, there may be formation of papillae. Recurrent conjunctival re-infection causes prolonged inflammation and conjunctival scarring. Scarring is associated with atrophy of conjunctival epithelium, loss of goblet cells and replacement of normal loose vascular sub-epithelial stroma with bands of collagen.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nTrachoma should be differentiated from:-\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Acute inclusion conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Neonatal conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toxic follicular conjunctivitis caused by topical medications or other compounds.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Allergic conjunctivitis which shows typical cobblestone papillae.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Trichiasis due to other causes such as entropion.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tWorld Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the \u2018SAFE\u2019 strategy for the management of trachoma.

Pigment may persist when the disease becomes inactive.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMixed VKC: \n\n\tMixed VKC shows features of both palpebral and bulbar forms.\n\nCorneal features:\n\n\tWhile corneal vascularisation is rare (late corneal vascularisation may take place), cornea may be affected in a variety of ways, such as:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK): Punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK) may result from toxic effect of inflammatory mediators. PEK can coalesce, resulting in frank epithelial erosion or shield ulcer.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Epithelial erosions: PEK may coalesce and form epithelial erosions.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shield Ulcer: Shield ulcers are oval-shaped epithelial defects and usually have their lower border in upper half of visual axis. Pathogenesis of shield ulcer is not well understood, major factor for its development may be chronic mechanical irritation from giant palpebral papillae. Healed shield ulcers may leave a sub-epithelial ring-like scar.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vernal pseudogerontoxon: Vernal pseudogerontoxon, with appearance of \u2018Cupid\u2019s Bow\u2019 (outline in a previously inflamed segment of the limbus), is a degenerative lesion in peripheral cornea resembling arcus (white ring in periphery of cornea) senilis. Pseudogerontoxon is a waxing and waning grey-white lipid deposition in superficial stroma of peripheral cornea.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plaque formation: Plaque is usually caused by epithelial erosions in which the bare area becomes coated with fibrin and layers of desiccated mucus. Plaque resists wetting by tears and re-epithelialisation. New vessel growth may occur in plaque.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sub-epithelial scarring: Sub-epithelial scarring, usually in the form of a ring, is a sign of previous severe corneal involvement.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconus: Keratoconus may be seen in chronic cases, which may be associated with chronic eye rubbing.\n\n\tThe skin of the eyelid and eyelid margin is relatively uninvolved. Conjunctiva of the fornices (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) usually does not show shortening and symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation is uncommon. Iritis (inflammation of iris) is not reported in VKC.\n\n\tNo precise diagnostic criteria, is established for VKC. Hyperaemia, itching, watering, photophobia and thick mucoid discharge are typical features of VKC. Large papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva and corneo-scleral junction are hallmarks of VKC.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry:\n\n\tHistopathology of conjunctival tissue shows a prominent inflammatory cellular infiltration in epithelium and substantia propria and post-inflammatory tissue remodelling. Tissue remodelling is more marked in palpebral rather than bulbar conjunctiva.\n\nTissue inflammation:\n\n\tTissue inflammation in chronic cases shows cellular infiltration of both stroma and epithelium, particularly in specimens taken from limbus. Cellular infiltrates consist of eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, plasma cells and B-lymphocytes, frequently organised as small lymphoid follicles without germinal center. Eosinophils are characteristic constituents of cellular infiltrates.\n\n\tIn palpebral conjunctiva, stromal infiltrate consists of diffuse T-lymphocyte reaction with clustering of B-lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells and mast cells.\n\nTissue remodelling:\n\n\tOvergrowth of conjunctival connective tissue, with formation of large and sessile papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva, is one of the most notable finding. Conjunctival thickening, subepithelial fibrosis, neovascularisation and scarring are typical in chronic cases. Epithelial changes, connective tissue deposition, cellular infiltration, oedema and glandular hypertrophy contribute in tissue remodelling.\n\n\tOn histological examination, number of goblet cells is increased in giant papillae and epithelial in-growth. Epithelial in-growth in stroma is rich in goblet cells and may give pseudo-glandular appearance. Collagen fibers in palpebral giant papilla are thicker, increased and irregularly arranged. A proliferation of capillaries and neo-vascular formations provide vascular support to the papillae. Various growth factors are increased in VKC as compared to normal subjects.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nMediators in VKC:\n\n\tNumber of mediators and cytokines in chronic inflammatory VKC occur on ocular surface:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cytokines: Cytokines are small secreted proteins that mediate and regulate immunity and inflammation. These are not stored in body, but have to be produced in response to a stimulus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chemokines: Chemokines are multi-potent cytokines which localise and enhance inflammation by inducing chemotaxis and cell activation of different inflammatory cells present at sites of inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Histamine: Histamine is an important inflammatory mediator in allergic eye disease and is released by activated mast cells and basophils. Skin test reactivity to histamine shows a greater wheal and flare response in patients with VKC, suggesting hypersensitivity. Histamine causes pruritus (itching), hyperaemia and participates in allergic inflammation and tissue remodelling by altering behaviour of conjuctival epithelium and fibroblasts.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Metalloproteinases (MMPs): Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular endopeptidases that selectively degrade components of extracellular matrix. Increased production and activation of MMPs is probably involved in the pathogenesis of conjunctival inflammation, remodelling and corneal changes.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Growth factors: Several growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor are increased in VKC. These factors induce fibroblast growth and pro-collagen production.\n\nCells in VKC:\n\n\tMast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and natural killer cells are seen in increased number in VKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mast cells: Mast cells play a key role in initiating inflammatory cascade. Mast cells are the constant feature of conjunctival tissue in patients of VKC. Increased number of mast cells in palpebral giant cells suggests an active role for these cells in abnormal connective tissue metabolism observed in VKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eosinophils: Eosinophils are the constant feature seen in lacrimal and conjunctival cytology. Majority of cells in tears during active phase of VKC are eosinophils. Eosinophils and mast cells are the main effector cells in ocular inflammation in VKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 T-lymphocytes: T-lymphocytes increase in conjunctiva of patients with VKC. T-lymphocytes play a vital role in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 B-lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes are responsible for IgE.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Natural killer cells: Increased Natural killer cells in conjunctiva suggests a potential role of these cells and innate immunity in VKC.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Epithelial cells: Epithelial cells act as mechanical barrier and participate in regulation of allergic inflammation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fibroblasts: Fibroblasts, maintains tissue structure, contribute to the induction and amplification of ocular allergic inflammation and tissue remodelling.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nVKC should be differentiated from:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atopic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Giant papillary conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral conjunctivitia.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Keratoconus.", "management":"Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\n\n\tEducation of patients and their parents about the chronic, recurrent and ultimately resolving nature of disease is an important aspect of management. Compliance with medical advice is better with a well-informed patient.\n\nMedical therapy:\n\nGeneral measures:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli such as exposure to wind, sun and salt water which causes frequent conjunctival redness.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avoid allergens: Contact with common allergens like plants and flowers should be avoided.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sunglasses: Use of protective sunglasses is helpful and should be advised.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Artificial tears: Artificial tears have been shown to be effective in relief of symptoms by direct removal and dilution of allergens from the ocular surface.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cold compresses: cold compresses provide symptomatic relief, especially from ocular pruritus.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Frequent washing: Frequent face, hand and hair washing, especially before going to bed, may be helpful.\n\nDrug therapy:\n\n\tMost drugs used are merely palliative, and are not enough to treat and eliminate allergic ocular inflammation, so there is recurrence of disease on discontinuation of therapy.\n\n\tJudicious and scrupulous use of medicines is important because drug treatment is prolonged and frequent. Some patients may need medicine throughout the year for satisfactory symptomatic relief.\n\n\tDrugs to treat VKC include:\n\n\tVariety of currently available drugs to treat VKC includes vasoconstrictors, anti-histamines, mast-cell stabiliser, dual-action drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and anti-metabolites.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical vasoconstrictor and non-specific anti-histamines: Topical vasoconstrictor and non-specific anti-histamine combination eye-drops are being used for long and are safe and effective, at least temporarily. Being available over the counter, these are tried by many patients during early stage of disease. These medicines relieve itching and reduce redness of eyes. There may be burning or stinging on instillation and rebound hyperaemia on discontinuation. This group contain vasoconstrictors like naphazoline or tetrahydrozoline and anti-histamines like pyrilamine and pheniramine.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Systemic anti-histamines: Systemic oral anti-histamines may be used when allergy involves the eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical mast-cell stabilisers: Topical mast-cell stabilisers prevent mast-cell degranulation or antagonise the effects of primary mediator histamine, being released by mast cells. Drug modulation of mast cell activity alleviates acute symptoms of active disease and reduces development of chronic allergic inflammation. These medicines may be used at the onset of allergic season and continued throughout the season. This group contain drugs like sodium cromoglycate, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical selective H1 receptor blockers: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of VKC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (dual action drugs): New generation of drugs show dual activity of H1 receptor antagonism and mast-cell stabilising property. Drugs in this group are olopatadine, epinastine, azelastine and ketotifen. These drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines and ketotifen prevents eosinophil accumulation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diminish ocular pruritus and conjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Drugs in this group are ketorolac and diclofenac. These medicines inhibit pruritogenic prostaglandin production, and are good alternative to corticosteroids.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are one of the most effective medicines to control symptoms of VKC. These should not be prescribed as first-line treatment due to associated complications with their prolonged use viz. Steroid-induced cataract, glaucoma and susceptibility to viral and fungal infections. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\n\n\tAlthough corticosteroids are the most efficacious medicines, steroid-resistant forms of VKC are not unusual and may necessitate alternative treatment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Immunomodulators: Immunomodulators like cyclosporine, a fungal metabolite, decreases signs and symptoms of VKC. However, symptoms may recur after discontinuation of cyclosporine eye-drops. Topical corticosteroids and artificial tears have been shown to act synergistically with cyclosporine eye-drops and help in re-epithelialisation of corticosteroid-resistant shield ulcers.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anti-metabolites: Anti-metabolites like Mitomycin-C (MMC) is an inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation. MMC decreases mucoid discharge, conjunctival hyperaemia and limbal oedema in patients who are refractory to topical steroids and mast-cell stabilisers.\n\nSurgical therapy:\n\n\tFollowing surgical measures may be taken:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Excision of giant papillae: Surgical excision of giant papillae is recommended if they cause lesions on the cornea. Excision of large papillae helps in early resolution of corneal epitheliopathy or ulcer, although papillae may regrow. Intra-operative application of MMC to upper palpebral conjunctiva immediately after papillae resection significantly reduces the chances of recurrence of papillae.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cryotherapy: Like excision of papillae, cryocoagulation may also helps in resolution of corneal epitheliopathy or ulcer. Cryotherapy of giant papillae leads to inflammation and may cause conjunctival scarring.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser: Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser may be used to remove giant papillae. This procedure may be repeated on recurrence of papillae.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Debridement of ulcer base: Debridement of ulcer base may promote re-epithelialisation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Removal of plaque: Surgical removal of plaque may also promote re-epithelialisation.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK) helps in early re-epithelialisation of vernal shield ulcer refractory to medical treatment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Free autologous (derived from self) conjunctival graft: Free autologous conjunctival graft after resection of giant papillae facilitates re-epithelialisation of non-healing shield ulcer.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amniotic membrane graft: Amniotic membrane graft leads to complete re-epithelialisation of persistent corneal epithelial defects and vernal plaques, not improving by conventional medical treatment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cultivated corneal epithelial cells: Cultivated corneal epithelial cells may be transplanted to treat severe ocular surface disease. There is significant improvement in vision after transplant. Corneal epithelial cell transplant is beneficial when amniotic membrane graft is not sufficient to restore ocular surface.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\nPrognosis:\n\n\tIn general, VKC is rather a benign and self-limiting disease that resolves with age or spontaneously at puberty. However, active disease is debilitating and necessitates therapy to contol signs and symptoms. In some patients, symptoms may persist beyond puberty into adulthood.\n\n\tVKC may lead to significant vision affecting corneal complications such as scarring, ulceration and opacification. Lid involvement may significantly compromise contact lens tolerance.\n\n\tMedications used for the disease may lead to complications such as preservative toxicity and steroid-induced glaucoma (raised intra-ocular pressure) or cataract.", "complications":"Ocular complications of VKC may include:\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal scarring.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal ulcer.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Corneal opacity.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Microbial keratitis (inflammation of cornea).\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hyperplasia of limbal tissue.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Steroid induced cataract and glaucoma.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Visual impairment.\n\n\t-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amlyopia may be caused by corneal opacity, irregular corneal astigmatism or keratoconus.\n\n\t-Glaucoma or cataract may be caused by unsupervised use of topical corticosteroids.", "Prevention":"Like most type I hypersensitivity disorders, avoidance of allergen is emphasised in prevention of disease.

(Other diseases belonging to this group are bejel (endemic syphilis) and pinta). Yaws is the most common of all and occurs primarily in the warm, humid and tropical areas of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Indian peninsula and the equatorial islands of South-East Asia.\n\n\tYaws is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Yaws is not a fatal disease, but causes disabilities and visible deformities of the face and extremities contributing to stigma and discrimination. It affects the skin, bone and cartilage; if left untreated it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. However, the disease can be cured and prevented by a single dose of antibiotics.\n\n\tIn India cases were first reported among tea plantation labourers in Assam in1887. Later on cases occurred in Orissa, Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other areas.\n\n\tIn India the disease is mostly known by the name of the tribes affected most in any region. Thus for example, the disease is called \u2018Madia Roga\u2019 and \u2018Gondi Roga\u2019 in Bastar area of Chattishgarh and Sironcha area of Maharashtra respectively and \u2018Koya rogam\u2019 in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Some synonyms of Yaws are based on clinical features like \u2018Domaru Khahu\u2019 in Assam which indicates fig like eruption. Chakawar is a term used for chronic ulcers in Central India and part of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\tThe disease was reported from tribal inhabited districts in states of Chattishgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Cases of Yaws were also reported from Madhya Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.\n\n\tThe disease has been eliminated from India in 2006 as no new yaws case has been reported after 2003 in the country. It has long been considered by World Health Organization (WHO) that Yaws can be eradicated because humans are the only reservoir.\n\n\tEradication of Yaws in India is possible because man is the only reservoir of infection; a single injection of long acting penicillin was effective; infection was localised to small pockets and; no case has been reported after 2003.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs316/en/\n\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.in/index3.asp?sslid=330&subsublinkid=313", "symtoms":"There are two basic stages of yaws: early (infectious) and late (non-infectious).\n\n\tIn early yaws, an initial papilloma (a circular, solid swelling on the skin, with no visible fluid) develops at the site of entry of the bacterium. This papilloma is full of organisms and may persist for 3\u20136 months followed by natural healing. Nocturnal bone pain and bone lesions may also occur in the early stage. These primary skin lesions (Early Yaws) usually occur in children and adolescents in endemic areas.\n\n\tLate yaws appears after 5 years of the initial infection and is characterized by disfigurement of the nose and bones, and thickening and cracking of the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These complications on the soles of the feet make it difficult for patients to walk.

Penicillin treatment is very useful in differential diagnosis because of miraculous relief seen in yaws but not in other skin diseases.\n\n\tMost latent and incubating cases are found in clusters around an infectious case and can usually be diagnosed by epidemiological tracing.\n\nSerology-\n\nStandard laboratory-based tests-\n\n\tSerological tests are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (e.g. syphilis and yaws). Serological tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis and its interpretation on adults in yaws endemic areas (disease constantly present in a particular region) need careful clinico-epidemiological assessment.\n\n\tCommonly used tests are Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test which are inexpensive, rapid and simple to perform. It takes time for sero-positivity to appear after the onset of disease and hence, initial (mother) case may be sero-negative.\n\nRapid point-of-care tests (medical testing at or near the site of patient care)-Rapid tests allow the point-of-care diagnosis and treatment of patients. There are 2 types of rapid tests:\n\n\tRapid treponemal tests are widely used in the diagnosis of syphilis; however, these tests cannot distinguish between present active yaws and past infections. Therefore, its use alone could lead to overtreatment of patients and over-reporting of cases.\n\n\tNew rapid dual (non-treponemal and treponemal) point-of-care syphilis test allows simultaneous yet separate detection of both antibodies. It is now being used in yaws eradication efforts.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)-\u00a0Genomic analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u00a0can be used to definitely confirm yaws, and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme. The PCR technique can also be used to determine azithromycin resistance from swabs taken from yaws lesions.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs316/en/\n\nhttp://www.ncdc.gov.in/index3.asp?sslid=330&subsublinkid=313", "management":"Two antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of Yaws by WHO.

The programme strategy included: (1) manpower development, (2) case finding (house to house visits by trained para- medical workers), (3) treatment of cases and contacts simultaneously and (4) Information, education and communication (IEC) activities involving multi- sectoral approach (such as inter- sectoral coordination and collaboration between the health and other departments like tribal development deptt., Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), panchayati raj, forest department and education department were involved in the YEP). 51 districts from 10 states from where yaws cases were reported were included in the programme.\n\n\tNumber of cases declined dramatically since 1996 and last lot of cases were reported during 2003. No new yaws case has been reported after 2003. Accordingly, on Sept 19, 2006, Govt. of India formally declared elimination of yaws from the country. Three new activities viz. sero- survey among children to assess cessation of transmission of infection, rumour reporting & investigation and cash incentive scheme to encourage voluntary reporting of the cases by the community were involved. Rs.5000/- was to be given to a confirmed case and Rs.500/- to the first informer of a confirmed yaws case on voluntary reporting.\n\n\tExperts also suggested continuing all the activities carried out since the beginning of the programme viz. active case search, routine reporting, training and IEC.\n\n\tNational Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in collaboration with state health directorates carried out sero- survey for three consecutive years (2009 \u2013 2011) in all the identified villages. All the samples collected were found to be negative for yaws. The programme\u2019s performance was monitored by independent appraisal missions consisting of experts.\n\n\tActive yaws case search operation was undertaken as per programme guidelines. No confirm case of yaws could be detected during any of the active search after 2003. The last Task Force meeting held in July 2014 recommended initiation of the process to get yaws eradication certificate from WHO.\n\n\tThe discovery in 2012 that a single, oral dose of the antibiotic azithromycin can completely cure yaws has reopened the prospects of yaws eradication.The WHO roadmap on neglected tropical diseases published in January 2012, targets the eradication of Yaws by 2020.\n\nKey points to remember \n\n\t\u2022 Yaws can be cured with a single-dose oral azithromycin\u00a0\n\n\t\u2022 The disease is transmitted through person to person contact\n\n\t\u2022 It affects mostly children as they often play together\n\n\t\u2022 Untreated, the infection can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability\n\n\t\u2022 Yaws occurs in poor rural communities in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific\n\n\t\u2022 Health education and improved personal hygiene are essential components of prevention\n\nReferences:\n\n\tJain SK, Thomas TG, Bora D, Venkatesh S, Eradicating Yaws from India: A Summary , J.
